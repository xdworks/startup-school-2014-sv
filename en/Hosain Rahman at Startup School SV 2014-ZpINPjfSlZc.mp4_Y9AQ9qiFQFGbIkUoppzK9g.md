**Hosain Rahman at Startup School SV 2014-ZpINPjfSlZc.mp4**

\[00:00:02\] Thank you for coming.

Thank hope.

Not much talking at all but I\'m going to just ask you sort of a strange thing.

I want you to sort of go through the chronology of the early days.

Yeah.

And talk about you really did have a lot of close calls and I\'d love for you to talk about them and how you got through them and said What do we call them the other day.

\[00:00:24\] Not near death experiences but defibrillator.

\[00:00:27\] Did you meet her.

She had to resuscitate.

\[00:00:30\] Yeah.

And I\'ve literally never heard of so many so I\'d love for you to give us a little story because it was back in 1999 when we started the company.

\[00:00:39\] It was 1989.

\[00:00:40\] I mean a lot of people don\'t know this but when we started we would sort of started working on the ideas and sort of 97 98 and 4 for lack of a better way to describe it we were trying to build Siri for mobile devices.

We\'ve been inspired by Palm and Nokia and all these folks that were sort of at the front of this this mobile device revolution and we thought why wouldn\'t it be great if you could talk to your phone.

And that would sort of transform the user interface experience and all that.

So we started with this kind of customer problem.

And that\'s always when we\'ve been good and when we stayed away when we stray away from trying to solve the customer problem we sort of fall down.

There\'s been a few those along the way.

But you know and so very early on we were we were trying.

We said okay voice would be a great way to interact with this.

How do we make basically Siri this voice interaction layer on top of the operating system and will we set out to do that we realize everything we want to do is reach recognition wasn\'t going to work.

And at the same time we sort of started to try to go raise money for this idea of a new way to interact with your device.

And you know I see now it was harder for us to raise our first half a million dollars than it was for us to raise our first 200 million dollars.

And it is because in those days people weren\'t in the valley they weren\'t so focused on mobile they certainly weren\'t thinking about mobile voice and we really needed to prove that we had everyone thought Yes there absolutely has to be a better way to interact with your device but what\'s your hook what\'s your advantage.

What\'s that kind of breakthrough and where we ended up doing is inventing this noise cancellation technology that turned out to be the biggest breakthrough in mobile audio in 30 years and it was a sort of serendipitous back thing that we stumbled upon mostly because we were trying to solve this problem.

And then when we did that we said wait this is bigger than making speech recognition work you get to the core of what people do on their phones which is talk at the time.

Now we do lots of other things on our phones but in those days it was it was a lot about talking mostly about talking.

And so then we thought OK great.

You know a is going to want this there.

Everyone that ever heard the demo where we do theseA.B tests with weed whackers and blenders and all this stuff and we still go on with their homes.

Wow I want to have my device as we said on this journey we started talking to all the handset manufacturers who were big at that time sort of Nokia and a role in the Korean guys Sony Ericsson Ericsson actually.

\[00:03:07\] And it was a real wakeup call.

No one actually wanted to see this technology.

Yeah it\'s a neat demo.

\[00:03:13\] We think it\'s cool they love the demo but they love the demo but they didn\'t want to integrate the technology was too expensive to add additional microphones.

\[00:03:21\] I was with somebody from Apple the other day who was telling me they now have six microphones I think in in an iPhone.

And at the time we were just trying to convince people to put an extra one in to support our technology.

It was just like wow I can imagine we would have been able to do audio quality with that.

But you know again we we were struggling to get our technology into that into that form factor in handset manufacturers were just sort of concerned about pennies so they didn\'t want to integrate what we had.

So that\'s how we were struggling with you know how do we fund this how do we take the next level.

We know we had something pretty breakthrough and what did we do and so along came darba.

And that was a great thing for us.

\[00:04:05\] The Defense Department and the government government agency were a good deal.

We never thought we would do sort of work for the military industrial complex.

What they wanted they wanted us to make our noise cancellation algorithms.

\[00:04:18\] The foundation of their battlefield technology.

And so we thought well great we have this kind of rough science how do we take that and productize it and use these government grants to really sort of work through all the issues and take that science into a form that could be delivered in a product.

And that was great.

You know it sort of kept the lights on.

We were it engineers we I think we were after Dolby and Macromedia one of the earliest technology companies will technology companies in San Francisco moved up to San Francisco in 1999.

In those days there just weren\'t a lot of startups in the city.

And it\'s funny now because I love it you walk around.

You know we\'re on the same block as Zynga and MBB and Pinterest.

Then we see a shared office with their baby and it\'s just it\'s so fun that there\'s this vibrant community there now it\'s Francisco wasn\'t like that.

\[00:05:06\] Yeah I think to remind people we\'re talking 15 years at all cost.

It\'s like filling donee.

But you know before I phones.

So.

So I want everyone to go back in their mine and we\'ll have these people were probably in grade school.

\[00:05:22\] Totally.

Let\'s hope they\'re all born.

So then what happened you get this right.

We get to start up a grant.

\[00:05:29\] And the other thing that was really tough is it\'s so again also farseeing because so many of the ideas that were being kicked around in 1999 and I remember Larry and Serguei were like our teachers in computer science and Marissa was my you know we lived in the same freshman dorm ish is now on the job on board and so it was this crazy time in Stanford and Silicon Valley and all these interesting ideas and people.

But you had this huge run up everything all the infrastructure being laid out for the internet as it stands today and all these ideas like there was a lot of delivery services like insta card.

Right.

But none of them survived.

And you know there were there were online specific e-commerce things for niches none of these things survived and they were just sort of too early there needed to be a lot either you know better internet connectivity more distribution of it whatever it was there was just there was just too early and so the ideas weren\'t bad they were just sort of ahead of their time.

And I think that\'s another important lesson that we learned is that you\'ve got to stay your course through that.

We thought mobile was going to be a big thing.

We thought that Palm devices would converge with smartphones.

They ended up doing it sort of ten years after we thought they would.

But they ended up doing that.

And so the early lesson we learned is if you believe in what you think is right and what you think is going to happen to customer experiences into the way people are going to interact with technology then stay that course and put yourself in a position to do that.

That was the sort of first thing with darba we went to a really unconventional source of capital right where were you who had DARPAs funding at that time.

Very very very few of you I just found out recently that Inktomi did too.

You know it\'s not something that remembers Inktomi.

No they powered a lot of the infrastructure our internet the younger.

Right.

So anyways when I haven\'t had a drop of funding is again that the whole technology industry had sort of cratered and it was impossible to raise money and I\'m a risk we used to go up announcing Sanyal road looking for money and people would say to us what\'s wrong with everyone who went to Stanford from 1983 to 2000 because of losses.

Billions of dollars.

Go get jobs.

We don\'t want to see you here.

I mean it\'s funny because I still run into some of these people like you now.

\[00:07:47\] It\'s different.

They don\'t tell me you\'ll get a job that they used to but you know.

\[00:07:52\] And so again it\'s interesting how the sort of time to change it was not a happy fun place full of new ideas and then the vibrancy wasn\'t there.

There was a really bad feeling around.

And so we had to figure out a way to keep going through that to believe that hey mobiles going to be a big thing.

And at the time the Valley wasn\'t the center of the mobile universe.

It is now for sure.

Right.

And so how did you get through it.

\[00:08:17\] You got since we had the type funding but that couldn\'t have lasted forever didn\'t last long.

They couldn\'t it didn\'t really allow us to scale.

\[00:08:23\] Yeah huge way but it did allow us to kind of prioritize productize improve out what we had done and the next thing we did is we said okay how do we get this in a forum or a product that\'s going to go reach lots of people.

And we\'ve been in sort of licensing discussion because we wanted to be like Dolby we said you know anyone that has an audio problem we could be in the front end it will be kind of like Intel inside or Adobeetc.

and because of various economic constraints for these very for these guys and focusing on profits that no one wanted to pay us much to license our technology and the time we\'ve been talking to the big headset manufacturers drunk\'s and Jabra and we thought wow the technology we have in this space is really disruptive.

There hasn\'t been sort of a computing proposition there and we can really transform what\'s Sebel there.

And so we\'ve we\'ve been offered some deals from those guys we backed out and said you know we\'re going to go the course ourselves and we\'re going to go make our own hardware device.

Wow.

So this is in kind of late 0 2.

And we thought we we can do this better and that\'s why we have hardware backgrounds at all.

\[00:09:28\] You know I\'d studied mechanical engineering as hairiness before there was a D school so we were kind of in the schools.

\[00:09:33\] We knew a little bit about it and some electricals was we knew a little bit about how to make things better enough to be dangerous enough to think that we could do it.

But knowing what I know now it\'s totally insane that we did it right.

\[00:09:48\] And I can\'t believe that anyway.

That\'s so.

I can\'t believe that people thought we might actually be able to do it right.

And and so you know again long story short we kind of together some parts and were able to raise some capital to go build the horror device.

\[00:10:05\] Now again in those days building consumer hardware as a start up was totally insane.

I think you know we did a study at that time the only other sort of venture funded consumer hardware company.

There\'s two had been apple right whenever that was in the late 70s and then palm.

\[00:10:28\] Oh my God.

And Pompe didn\'t really stay around very long it became part ofU.S.

Robotics even before they launched the company.

And so there had been no examples.

If you look and say OK this is something that we took the cycle built the product scale the build distribution got it out and then there was there was an exit so there was no sort of pattern that people could point to in talking to anybody I mean there was big failures I go in some of these when Bill Campbell\'s vote with that joint or these guys.

And so just convincing people that we knew it was going to take to do that was really really hard and I remember when we raised venture capital in 2003 it was like when the only deals the firm at the time it Don.

And it was insane to go build the stuff and then we set about going to build our first kind of consumer heads and that\'s when we started really think about design.

And before that you know in the valley design was a sort of thing that once you had a little momentum you might put like a cool case on something or a different color or whatever and if you wonder peel the women you made it pink and and is saw what people thought of design.

The only other company that was really sort of saying that there is this intersection of technology design was Apple in 0 1 0 2 really with the iPod at a mass scale.

And so for us we were fortunate to have such a great you know kind of tip of the arrow in apples are going in cutting down the path in front of us.

And again so long story short we we put these elements together and we we realize how hard it was to take these complex algorithms and to figure out all of the little details you needed to think about in order to make this product great.

And you know sometimes I sort of sit and wonder.

We make lots of products and I\'ve been fortunate ship tens of millions of things.

But I look at you know Tesla makes cars and I think about all the details that we have to think about to get it right and I can\'t imagine how you can sort of process all of that all the time from you know there\'s just a million different things that can go wrong that you have to think about when you build a car.

Right.

And it\'s it\'s not dissimilar when you build these very complex consumer products where you\'ve got software interacting with hardware and now talking to the cloud and how do these things work.

There\'s very little patience people have for things not working anyway so kind of flash forward.

We ended up launching our first consumer product which was a headset and it was it.

And there was sort of a precursor where I knew that we might be going wrong on this.

This first product and I had the first time I was fortune of means Steve Jobs was in mid 2004 right before on Walton carers conference because we were going on stage to debut our product and it had been set up to meet him is the god of consumer electronics right.

\[00:13:17\] And I once saw him and it was for 45 minutes of absolute just I\'m not united Scriba we just got killed.

Absolutely killed on every single decision every single edge every single technology decision the crazy part is I knew everything that he said was right and we had known that deep in our hearts and we didn\'t because we were trying to meet a timetable and because we were trying to you know not run out of money and ship the thing on time we sort of made all these tradeoffs and we compromised a lot of things that we know it\'s knew better on.

And for me it was a really galvanizing moment because I remember that hey you know this guy who\'s really good at this is telling me that that was wrong and we shouldn\'t compromise on what we know is true right.

\[00:14:07\] Was the first one is like shit we should have gone with our got sort of harsh but valuable feedback.

Totally okay.

\[00:14:14\] It was unemotional but like brutal just really really really brutal.

You know just cutting like go down the only place I remember we were talking about like this thing was crazy and if anyone\'s ever certainly played on in this audience remembers it.

But it was a big head said and it connected to a clip on your belt and then it plugged into your phone and we were arguing about the clip and the guy at the time that we had hired was like Oh no.

But you will clip this through your belt and Steve was like the only place they will ever clip that is in your mind.

\[00:14:47\] And he was right.

\[00:14:48\] He was right.

We probably saw more units sitting here right now than we did of that first brought it because it shipped it got all this great buzz.

We were products of the year and time magazine sort of and we saw five of them because it was because it had all these problems.

We knew that it was this cool technology that was this really interesting intersection of wait we didn\'t stay true to the kind of customer experience and the problem that we\'re trying to solve for the user.

We compromise all these things to meet all these schedule criteria.

Funny and are real constraints.

Right.

\[00:15:21\] And when you follow your instinct didn\'t follow the gut that gut instinct we knew better and that was the hardest thing about my conversation with Steve and I did Sinnamon e-mail after that saying you were right on everything.

I appreciate that you actually took the time to be honest with me because few people are.

In.

And it was it was sort of he was always like that with us.

And then we launched several other products with Apple like the Jambox and up and all those things we had a great relationship with our company and continue to but we learned a lot from my experience.

So going a little bit further on what happened.

We have launched this thing was totally stillborn didn\'t sell any.

We ran out of money.

And now it was like oh my god what do we do.

And again very long story short people at the time they were supporting us are investors sort of lost faith and they shut the company down.

People don\'t realize it\'s like almost shut down.

All the employees were laid off.

They literally chained the doors and they chain the doors in the chains locks the whole thing.

\[00:16:24\] I have a letter of says everyone we don\'t see any value in this thing with many all the employees it was gone right.

Because in those days as entrepreneurs and founders it\'s a lot more friendly now than it used to be from investors like you actually get to control your company.

\[00:16:38\] Actually we were kicked off the board we weren\'t sure kicked off the board account password we didn\'t have a say in these kinds of competition it was like thanks very much for your ideas.

We\'ll take it from here.

\[00:16:48\] So well that\'s changed a lot.

So what shows up in their chains their chains of doors.

\[00:16:53\] But the thing that I had in my Cofan really had as we still believed that we had created something special.

We still believed in the mission and we still believe that we could improve people\'s lives and that we could allow them to communicate better and that we could sort of push this step forward.

And so what we ended up doing is we\'re kind of wrestling back from those investors.

I think it\'s a good plan.

We had 60 grand in the bank 600 grand dad.

We took another good Darboe contract and we focused it and said What are all those mistakes that we made that we knew better on.

And often failure is the best teacher that you can have right.

Because you learn so much more because you think about every single angle of 540 degrees you look at again and again and again and you look at what went wrong and why did that happen.

\[00:17:39\] Are you using a pen at this point.

\[00:17:41\] Are your investors still in voir where they just sort of go they said Just go take it away or go to the board last time just go do whatever.

Okay.

It wasn\'t even they were.

It wasn\'t even a considered decision was good you\'re starting with a blank slate blank slate.

Right.

\[00:17:56\] And we had this cool technology that had all this promise and people resonated with it when they got in so we figured out that it had to get into the right package of the right form or the right way that people could access it and interact with it.

Right.

And so we had failed on what I think about sort of is all what design is all about which is the attention to the right details and resolving those details to make the best possible experience for the customer.

Right.

And we\'ve missed that.

Right.

And we\'ve missed it in a big way and it nearly put us out.

And so again you know we focus for the next two years we work for no salaries kept Darpas sort kept the lights on as did our friends and families.

And then we focused on our first headset and that was when we started to think about wearable computing actually.

And it\'s funny because now everyone talks about wearables everyday people every hour I get a question about wearables and where is it going and what\'s happening.

That\'s when we start to think about these things in your body that have all this computing power how are they going to try to services and all that stuff Sony as we plowed through that those two years of probably another you know two days of crazy stories.

\[00:19:00\] Can you talk at all about the shipping.

\[00:19:03\] You love the Celesio we went through two years no salaries.

We had you know Vienneau and David Weiden from Kosal ventures it helped us get a deal with AT&T to launch are you know kind of next generation Bluetooth headset and everything is lined up.

\[00:19:20\] We have big customer we still can raise much capital to get it off the ground.

It was tough but Venona and David sort of solemn promise that kind of just advising us to see what would happen.

And we were trying to launch it was late in December.

We had product in a dock in New York and the manufacturer wouldn\'t release it to us because we didn\'t have any money in the bank.

We literally had like twenty seven hundred dollars in the bank and we had to figure out how to get those products released out ofU.S.

Customs they could deliver to AT&T Cingular.

\[00:19:53\] It\'s time to get into stores which are like Chris Chris Christmas and anyone that\'s launching your product like December 21st is not a good time entreprise for Christmas.

It\'s kind of too late.

So that was a whole nother story so we convince you to still take it in.

And then one of our earliest Angels is guys Chris Birch an awesome.

They gave us a letter of credit to unlock and I had to go to JFK to go flying the Customs people and figure out what the harmonized code was for this type of product and get them to release the stuff so it could get in to stores and Mossberg wrote about in the journal and it sold out in a few hours.

Wow.

\[00:20:33\] I think we went from zero to 70 million in revenue in the first year.

So that\'s the thing that I learned that I hope people take away is when you actually go focus on ruthlessly what those things are that you\'re trying to solve those problems.

You can transform your business like that.

The other stuff sort of you\'ve got to figure it out it\'s not easy but that\'s the core thing.

Right.

And if you don\'t do it everything gets really bad.

And if you do then you can build from there and things transform overnight like that.

\[00:21:03\] So literally it was like this it was like overnight overnight overnight.

\[00:21:06\] Then what happened then we had to go build a business we had to scale we had to build a team we weren\'t fortunate in that situation where you know we would raised a bunch of money built out our team made the product.

It was a success that we could scale from that we had no infrastructure right so we went 070 million with a consumer hardware product with like at that moment in the beginning of December of 0 or sorry beginning of January 07 we had 16 people.

So we scaled that Ellisville revenue grew to like 22.

And that\'s when you know the node and Marken Banten Benowitz American resellers cloud guys all kind of came in and we started to build the company and then you know we had this sort of streaming 2000 a business was growing growing growing and then all of a sudden you know you had the big meltdown of 2008 where Lehman Brothers exploded and we found ourselves with a million units on backorder and all of a sudden those orders just got canceled and we had like 70 million or 50 or 70 million dollars worth of inventory in China we had to go then learn to work that down and we spent a lot of 2009 working that down to zero did a big deal costs go to move it.

\[00:22:17\] So it was just you know all of these bumps and bruises and again we experience it in in the fall of 2011.

You know we had I had announced this product on stage this foray using all the stuff we learned about sensors and headsets and now translate it to health and it was this massive problem.

I literally debut the thing on stage at TED and we\'re like a billion media impressions around it.

\[00:22:42\] And it was the most hype product.

I still think it was the fastest selling third party product in the history of Apple Retail that fall and it was going out there and all of a sudden we were starting to hear issues of them breaking at scale and we didn\'t we couldn\'t even get units back to figure out what was wrong fast enough.

And here was this sort of incredibly hyped product.

We had to try.

We were thinking about levitating in that category even before we had learned how to crawl let alone walk.

And you know all this hype and you don\'t even know what to do with respect to the consumer.

I think we\'re fortunate because we\'ve been through some hard times.

So there is a DNA in the organization that we could sort of take a step back and say you know what.

Like let\'s just try to figure out what\'s happening first principle as it\'s make sure we take care of the customer make sure our users are happy that you know the first question I ask is are we doing any physical harm to people.

Anything wrong is it like hurting people.

Not okay.

What\'s happening.

Fire is catching fire is burning people\'s risk.

That happened one of our competitors.

Not good.

So you know you know I think that you got to sort of go from there.

We had been fortunate that we\'ve been through hard times it was never the sort of straight shot of success.

And I often tell people like look the problems that you see appearance when you\'re five people with you know a you know tens of thousands of dollars in the bank versus when you\'re you know worth billions in market value and hundreds of millions of dollars in big channels because they are no less existential or nerve racking.

They\'re just a different scales.

And so if you learn to sort of persevere through those things and you focus on the things that matter you\'ll carry those skills with you through the whole journey.

Right.

And don\'t forget those lessons of of what it was like to be on the ground with you know kicked your teeth kicked in and they saw their blood and how you go through it and then what we ended up doing with up is we we figured out that we had an issue.

And I sat down and wrote a letter and said to people that I\'m sorry we made a mistake and we screwed up and give you your money back and keep the product.

And you know we\'ll take you through it and we\'re gonna go fix this stuff and we back in.

And when we came back consumers embraced us and you know people I was surprised because the reaction the letter went from I was getting death threats on Twitter to literally my life to you know some people saying wow like that\'s the example of how you treat customers and all we were we weren\'t trying to think about that we were just like what\'s the right thing to do.

Right.

\[00:25:15\] So I feel like I\'d tell people never to start a competitor to a job or any of your products like the toughest founder he\'s been through.

So my bed never survive.

So we have a couple more minutes.

I know there\'s so much I wanted to get through.

\[00:25:29\] Hopefully that was the good news.

\[00:25:31\] We talked about some of the Near Death fans that I love.

You talk about how hard it is to take software and hardware and data and bring them together.

\[00:25:41\] So it\'s well I mean what we\'re doing now is I feel like everything over the last 14 years has been a preparation for it.

I feel like we\'ve been going to school where we learn how to build these great high design products.

And we\'ve been fortunate to be sort of recognized for it.

And one of the things that was interesting about the first launch is we had built our own application from scratch.

We\'d never done that before.

You know in 2011 Begaye 2011 we didn\'t have an application team.

We had to build that from scratch.

And so one of the things that the hardware defects matched was how crap our apples.

It was really bad.

A lot of my friends like Zork and all these little guys said What are you doing making software.

We\'ve always made software just that the algorithm level for more analyst stuff but you know it was a really tough learning experience to get people who come from the application world to work with people who work in hardware and not to have them work in silos.

And then some magical point for it all to come together you realize that doesn\'t actually work.

And so I used a lot of 2012 the kind of rip it all down and say look it what we learn in hardware\'s you have to make stuff that people will pay you more than what it costs you to make which is a really interesting discipline because you end up being really focused on is this good enough that someone would take a dollar out and pay you for it.

Right.

In App development in lots of Web Volm and mobile apps people don\'t have that discipline because you don\'t everything is free and it just sort of moves quickly and so people iterate and you just figure out stuff but there isn\'t that discipline of like is it good.

Are we solving that problem.

Will people pay us for it.

Right.

And so we took that sort of a sensibility from the hardware team and we kind of tried to get our software guys to think about their experiences in that way around trying to resolve it to a point where yeah we\'re making decisions and we\'re making judgments on where this is going to go and how it comes together.

But then we got the speed at which the software guys could iterate sort of infuse our hardware it seems as though they tried to get the best of each of these things were and then ultimately what it is I organize it against the user problem and I said we are solving this customer problem and we were going to use these things as tools whether it be the software app or we\'re going to solve that hardware or going to solve in the cloud with data.

That was another new thing for us is to build the whole data science team.

I think we have a world class when we start to publish a lot of those results.

I measured as world class because Google and Facebook and these guys are trying to recruit out of our team which I think is a sign that you\'ve arrived when the big shots are trying to steal your people.

But you know putting all those elements together and getting them all talk to each other because they speak different languages is really difficult and I think that\'s the new tip of the arrow right and I think this comes back to that advantage that we have against people who have traditionally been successful in CS CS totally different than what it was.

There are a lot of these dumb boxes their boxes where the application experience and software is just as important as what you physically touch.

And there\'s a there\'s a melding of those lines I tell people when we think of design in mobile applications it\'s something between three dimensions and two dimensions.

It\'s not like just a little visual thing you\'ve got it you\'ve got to interact with and that\'s not quite three dimensions where you can feel the button but it\'s something in between and we\'re sort of putting this piece together but again it\'s all about here\'s the problem we\'re trying to solve and how do these pieces how do you move around actually go solve that.

\[00:29:12\] Well sadly we are over.

Thank you.

Congratulations on all of your hard won second half.

\[00:29:19\] I\'m obsessed with my Jambox many thank you for coming today.
