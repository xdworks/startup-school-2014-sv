**Ron Conway at Startup School SV 2014-qvHhhIfu7Lo.mp4**

\[00:00:02\] He\'s back for a day or an hour.

\[00:00:07\] There\'s lights behind that thing.

OK.

\[00:00:11\] So I interviewed Ron on this stage were on stage at Startup School in 2012 and the videos on YouTube.

\[00:00:22\] Ron told a lot of the good stories then so I\'m not going to ask him about that stuff.

\[00:00:28\] But Ron has an infinite supply of for anybody if there\'s anybody out there who doesn\'t know who run Connolly is basically just remember this sentence.

Ron Conaway is the man now not in the sense of like working for the man not that man that man.

The other man.

He is like the investor.

I told Weiss startups just this blanket advice if Ron Conway wants to invest in you take his money.

So that\'s all you have to remember about Ron Conway a baby Laughter Why C is for creating laughter.

So Ron is famous for investing in founders.

And so I wanted to ask you when you say you invest in founders what that means is you invest in people with certain traits.

Can those traits be acquired.

Or is it just the case that some people have it and some people don\'t.

Because these people are interested in starting startups right.

So I\'m going to try and get the stuff out of your brain.

Blow it out onto the other.

That will be helpful to them without being sloppy.

\[00:01:49\] What I have said before entrepreneurs are born to be entrepreneurs.

\[00:01:57\] Then once you\'re an entrepreneur you\'re a serial entrepreneur or you\'re probably going to start companies for the rest of your life or if you\'re like Zucker Larry Page you know it might be the only company you start but you are an entrepreneur for life.

And I think most entrepreneurs do correctly self select.

And I think that entrepreneurs are born have to be born with some of the basics.

So which treats have to be in Born which can be learned so that the basics I think would be you have to have a hell of a work ethic.

You talked about it at your Stanford class.

You have to be ambitious.

You have to be aggressive and you have to be tough because starting a company is the hardest thing on earth to do.

And I don\'t think people realize that until they do it.

Since I\'ve watched thousands of entrepreneurs do it I know how hard it is.

Plus I started my own company Alto\'s computer in the 70s so I know from personal knowledge how hard it is and I started another company of companies as well.

And so you think the driven part has to be inborn for sure.

You can\'t you can\'t learn to be ambitious and be driven.

Obviously you have to be curious you have to be intelligent.

I think being a founder is like it.

It\'s like a vocation but if you have those basic skills you know where you\'ve got where you\'re you\'re determined you\'re tough.

You have a huge work ethic.

You\'re completely Reifel focused.

Then there\'s other things that you that you have to learn you have to learn to hire a management team.

You have to learn how to manage these things you\'re not born with these things you have to want success so badly that you learn how to manage you learn how to find a management team.

You learn how to recruit people and then spread your vision and and motivate them to be just like you and be fanatical about your business.

So \[00:04:20\] how can they tell.

How can these people you know it would save them a lot of trouble if you can tell them now whether they\'re gonna succeed in starting a startup how can they tell if they\'re driven enough.

\[00:04:31\] Well well I mean are you willing to work 24/7.

The really great entrepreneurs are 24/7.

The word moonlighting is not even in their vocabulary.

I mean if they\'re dating somebody or they\'re married they warn their spouse that they\'re not first in line that this company dream is first in line and that that you have this vocation.

You know it\'s like being a priest or a nun that that your duty is to your company.

Now it has to be that fanatical and if you look at all the successful entrepreneurs they are that committed about it.

That is a hard commitment.

But once you\'re willing to make that commitment you know then you know that solves the work ethic check off if you have that commitment then then your passion is probably infectious.

\[00:05:31\] It probably means you can in fact find other people and make them as excited about your idea as you do so you can use it so you have to be a good communicator you\'ve got to be able to excite other people or the management part you can use a trick of leading by example.

Yes right.

You don\'t have to use leadership techniques you just say I\'m going to go do this and everybody goes as it with you.

Correct.

\[00:05:53\] But but for management and recruiting you do have to educate yourself.

You have to get advice about that.

\[00:06:00\] Now there\'s many many books and blogs about how to do that.

So if you have the desire you can you can DIY you can do it yourself because there is lots of resources out there for you to educate yourself on the skills that you have to acquire that you\'re not born with them.

\[00:06:19\] They don\'t have to worry about managing people yet though that\'s like a good problem to have.

\[00:06:25\] Yeah yeah.

Freed\'s you\'ve gotten to a certain point you can afford to hire people that you then have to manage.

Yeah.

\[00:06:31\] The first thing you gotta do is your idea has to be infectious enough that you have to find a co-founder.

Since most companies start with with at least two people and they usually start with two people who know each other yeah.

And so they\'re able to feed on each other\'s excitement and then go from there.

\[00:06:51\] So when you\'re when you\'re deciding who to invest in.

This is not just a way to get Ron\'s money it\'s also heuristic for figuring out what works because how many startups you invest in now since this is my 20th year of angel investing.

\[00:07:07\] So anniversary just like it\'s the 10th Startup School and in the 20 years we\'ve invested over 750 companies but in investing in the 750 companies each of which has a founder\'s team we have talked to thousands of companies about potentially investing because for every company we invest in we look at 30.

So what.

Well yeah 21000 company.

That\'s that\'s why I age ages up to 13 people.

You realize you\'ve looked at 21000 companies.

Yes.

Now I didn\'t look at them all because SCVNGR is 13 people now.

Funny enough.

I don\'t I don\'t do any due diligence anymore.

I just help portfolio companies with with hard unique problems with the SVR teams completely build out now and they do all the diligence.

Okay.

I\'m not a lottery picker.

How does the Espey team how does the SBA Angel team work.

Well we\'re up we\'re up to 13 people.

\[00:08:10\] If you look at me you could call me the grandfather because David Lee and Brian Pokornya.k.a.

coach they\'re becoming the Wise Old Men.

I mean they\'ve been around me now for close to 10 years each.

And so they they have the pattern recognition.

\[00:08:31\] They\'re now solving all the problems I used to solve five years ago so everybody\'s escalating their role.

And then you have Kevin Carter and tofor my son who are also becoming wise old men because they\'ve been around Espey Angel for five years.

But but we are Reifel focused on generational planning.

I believe this industry belongs to young people.

And so you know tofor and Kevin are getting close to 30 and we\'ve actually said when you\'re 30 you know you better make sure you have we have four or five people at Esmie Angel in their 20s because the people in their 20s are the good pickers.

And then as you get wiser and older you\'re more better advice givers to the founder.

\[00:09:23\] Interesting interesting.

So there\'s that\'s interesting that in the adventure business picking and giving advice are different skills that peek at different ages correct in our opinion absolutely.

\[00:09:35\] So I\'m an age of bigot and I keep telling our team mate make sure we hire and bring in really smart 20 year olds cause in in 30 years I hope they\'re Roncon way and they\'re being interviewed you know by Sam.

\[00:09:53\] You need investors you can actually do the hill use instant messaging apps that link make the photo disappear and stuff like that.

\[00:09:59\] Yes.

Great.

Yeah.

Kevin Carter on our team.

Twenty four at the time he picked that company he tapped me on the shoulder.

\[00:10:10\] He goes that\'s important.

Go fly toL.A.

and spend time with him.

\[00:10:15\] Okay and that worked out.

That worked out.

Yeah.

\[00:10:20\] By the way if you want a list of the companies Ron has invested in it it would be shorter to give a list of the ones he hasn\'t invested in.

\[00:10:27\] Just assume that if you\'ve heard of some big famous startup run as an investor and you\'ll you\'ll pretty much be right.

I just assume it.

So what about what should people do.

I was just talking about this what people should do in college if they wanted to start a startup later.

What do you think people should do before starting a startup.

Do you have opinions about that.

\[00:10:52\] Well I you know whether or not they\'re in college for me really doesn\'t matter because there are founders who didn\'t go to college at all.

Are founders who went to some of college and dropped out and then there some that went all the way through college Larry and Serguei went all the way through college and dropped out of the JD program at Stanford.

\[00:11:17\] So I don\'t think it\'s about where you\'re at.

I think it\'s about when when the idea comes in your mind that compelling idea that aha moment that says this is it.

\[00:11:31\] This is a company and it\'s usually based around a personal experience where where you have that aha moment and you\'re so motivated by it and taken by it that if you\'re not in school or if you\'re in school it doesn\'t matter you stop what you\'re doing and go pursue that idea.

\[00:11:52\] So what you want to do is you want to set yourself up so you have these aha moments these personal experiences correct you and you could almost be anywhere for that to happen.

\[00:12:02\] I mean for Chad Hurley and Steve Chen they were at a dinner party took a video and found out that there was no easy way to upload that video and just share it with the other guests with Zach.

It was like I don\'t want to go through the physical hard copy Facebook at Harvard.

Why can\'t that just be on my computer.

And then 10 years later why can\'t that be on my phone.

Yeah.

So you know Shawn Fanning his roommate wanted to share songs with other people in his dorm.

So Shawn Fanning hacked together a music sharing app.

\[00:12:42\] So it\'s it\'s based around a need and an idea in all that creates the huge companies in all the cases you mentioned the need was the founders own need.

Absolutely.

\[00:12:54\] All the biggest companies are based on a founder who had a need hacked it together and then said hey wait a minute other people probably want this and then and then they start to grow on their own.

\[00:13:10\] Notice what you said.

The realization that other people might want it comes afterwards correct.

So it really it\'s not even supposed to be for other people in the beginning.

Yeah yeah a lot of it is serendipity.

\[00:13:22\] But once once the serendipity phase gets over then you need to start thinking about product market fit you know who is the customer for this.

It\'s all about users which is why why see is so successful is once you come up with the idea then why mantra is well how do you how do you how do you find users who also want this product.

\[00:13:47\] Because unless you create a market there is no need for the product.

\[00:13:51\] When you look at startups and you\'re thinking of investing in them do you care a lot about the story about how they started working on the idea.

\[00:13:59\] I absolutely do.

I mean I think the more compelling and personal story is the more excited I get about the company early on even though I don\'t know you know whether or not it\'s going to be a huge huge company.

But what I\'ve said it probably to a lot of people in this room one of the first questions I ask is what inspired you to start the company and it is an inspiration.

\[00:14:27\] You know when it goes in your head you are inspired by it and then and then you are driven by it.

\[00:14:37\] So do you also care a lot about the story about how the founding team.

Do you hear tension to that.

\[00:14:44\] Yes.

Very very important to understand how you as I said before most companies have a couple of founders and it\'s very important to know how those two founders met how they interact with each other.

Remember when we first meet them it\'s usually two or three people and I\'m always watching how they interact.

If one person starts answering the other person\'s question then interrupts them a lot you know ding ding ding.

The warning signal those two founders from aren\'t going to get along forever and they\'re probably right now fighting about who\'s going to be the CEO when in the early days it doesn\'t matter who the CEO is it matters if you can find users and you have a compelling product.

\[00:15:31\] So how can these people be they.

They\'re interested in starting startups.

How how can they find potential co founders when they have someone they\'re thinking of starting a company with.

Watch what sort of filter should they.

How should they apply.

How can they tell if this person would make a good co-founder.

\[00:15:47\] Well most cofounders you know when I think about this most cofounders are collaborating and end up coming up with the idea together.

\[00:16:01\] If you look at Facebook Pinterest Google there\'s there are two founders for all.

Two or three there\'s two founders for all these companies and they actually come up with the idea together.

Yes one of them is the one that says I feel the need.

But the co-founder ends up being a friend of theirs or a colleague who says Wow I agree with you and I want to work on that.

Wow.

I think that\'s goofy and I don\'t want any part of it.

But it\'s the co-founder is usually somebody who shares like 99 percent of the excitement and inspiration of the person who came up with the idea.

\[00:16:42\] So you don\'t.

Chad Hurley and Steve Chen.

You don\'t just want to work on interesting problems.

You want to work on interesting problems with other people.

\[00:16:51\] Absolutely it\'s a collaborative process.

You know how excited are you going to get or accomplish something if it\'s just you.

\[00:17:01\] I mean there are single founder companies out there but very few.

\[00:17:06\] Why.

Why do you think there are so few.

Because I can tell you from looking at Y Combinator applications a huge number of single founders applying twice maybe half the applications are single founders.

I didn\'t know that.

Yeah well no but like they\'re disproportionately unlikely to get accepted.

\[00:17:24\] Yeah.

\[00:17:25\] So.

There you go.

There you heard it here.

You heard it here.

\[00:17:31\] If you fly to icy there should be two of you but not if that means like putting something like Craigslist snobbism flying away.

Yeah don\'t do that.

It obviously can\'t be forced.

\[00:17:44\] So if you get this idea in your head think about Mark Zuckerberg or Ben Silverman you know Ben Silverman\'s idea when he started Pinterest was really obtuse you know where he said I think people should be using the Internet to discover things and people look at them like wow.

\[00:18:04\] What\'s that about.

Well you know I used to collect things when I was a kid.

If you put those collections on the Internet and enough people put on their collections people start discovering things that they\'re interested in sound so lame doesn\'t it.

\[00:18:19\] History has proven that it is not.

No I know but all the time so the time it took him forever to get funded.

\[00:18:26\] So what did what did Ben Silverman do.

Everyone he talked to starting with his mother who I think is the biggest spender on earth.

He evangelized his product and talked to anyone he could find and said What do you think of this.

And then you find someone who says Jesus I think that is awesome.

That is so interesting.

Can I work with you on it.

\[00:18:50\] KABUM you have a co-founder.

You have somebody as excited as you are about this brand new neophyte idea.

\[00:18:59\] All right so if you if you have actually built the thing with another person that\'s a good sign that they would make a good co-founder because they have the same credibility as you.

So how did people know when their idea that they\'re so excited about is actually bad if what if.

How can they tell if a lame sounding idea is actually lame or if it\'s just one of these ideas it sounds lame in the beginning because it\'s such an outlier.

\[00:19:24\] Well yeah I mean you have to be careful about that because a lot of ideas that seem like they are bad end up being huge.

So I think it\'s about persistence and conviction about your idea.

\[00:19:39\] How can you tell as an investor see these companies as an age where the idea CEOs still seem OK as an investor.

\[00:19:46\] I cannot tell that all ASV Angel invests in is people so we end.

So yeah we don\'t even know we cannot predict the success or failure in 40 percent of our investments fail.

We think that failure rates lower than most of the industry but we can\'t tell.

So we invest in the traits of the individual.

\[00:20:12\] OK so let\'s talk about specific individuals.

BEN SILVERMAN For example what what traits did he have that made you invest OK.

\[00:20:22\] For him it was his rifle focus on the product.

Now keep in mind Reifel focus on the product also applied to Larry Zuck.

It you know Dropbox RVN be it applies to every successful founder is they were Reifel focused about the product to the point of being rude and a lot of them get accused of being arrogant because they\'re so focused on the product because other people say hey will you come to this event or will you get interviewed by the New York Times and they\'re going like why would I ever want to do that.

\[00:21:01\] When I can make my product better because guess what.

I went from 10000 users last month to 25000 users and in the next month I can get it to 50 or 100000 users why would I want anyone to distract me with anything else.

And that focus on the product is what builds huge companies.

And you know it\'s so contagious other people want to come join your team and help you.

But some some of the ones that were counterintuitive would be like an air b be like they want me to share a room in my house.

\[00:21:37\] But the 2008 mortgage crisis in New York helped Air B and B cause in New York in 2008.

There were thousands of people if they didn\'t rent a room in their house they were going to be foreclosed on.

And that was that was the mushrooming of Air B and B and then lo and behold they found out that every single person on earth wants to do this.

Yeah it\'s sort of this is a worldwide phenomena.

\[00:22:05\] Dropbox would be another example.

I already have a storage device.

Why.

Why would I want to move to the cloud.

What\'s that.

\[00:22:13\] Do you remember when you first met Drew Housden yes.

What was it about him that you like.

What traits.

\[00:22:19\] Yeah well shame on me I didn\'t invest in Dropbox right away.

\[00:22:23\] So I was you know in that case I saw a great entrepreneur and I sometimes we do get over opinionated about the idea and that is always a mistake when we do drop Oxenham BMB we love the founders cheese that idea.

The idea is not our job in my opinion.

Yeah our job is to invest in great great founders.

\[00:22:50\] I know this sounds like an insulting question but it\'s really interesting you\'ve been doing this for 20 years.

Why are you still making this mistake.

\[00:22:57\] Laughter No I mean it\'s interesting right.

There\'s there must be like this.

It\'s really powerful magnet like pulling you off to the side.

\[00:23:05\] It\'s a very risky business.

And since the beginning you knowS.V.

Angel kind of invented the portfolio approach to investing.

I always intuitively thought there\'s no way I\'ll ever make the right decision every time so I\'d rather make the right decision about a certain market place and then go find the 20 best companies and hope that one of those wins.

\[00:23:32\] And that strategy ends up you know it\'s a great strategy when you started you had this little niche market place called the Internet Internet software.

\[00:23:42\] Right.

It was.

I\'m not joking.

\[00:23:43\] Back in 1994 when I started this was investing in 1994 Mark Andriessen had just graduated from the University of Illinois had not started Netscape but in 1994 I had finished doing three startups and had dabbled in angel investing and said I want to do this the rest of my life.

I teamed up with Ben Rosen who was then the chairman of Compaq and we said and we both had plenty of gray hair at the time.

We said okay let\'s go angel invest together.

OK what are we going to invest in.

Because we were going to invest in everything and we said let\'s invest.

You said not hardware yet for sure not hard already done that and for sure not packaged software because I had done that.

\[00:24:33\] And we said let\'s invest in this thing called the Internet because it it\'s at zero and we can watch it grow and therefore it\'ll be interesting and exciting and 20 years later that is all we\'re doing Internet software.

\[00:24:54\] So I notice the words you\'re using here you haven\'t mentioned anything about money.

\[00:25:00\] I think that that you mean making money or because you\'re investors everybody thinks investors are like in it for the money.

\[00:25:08\] Right.

\[00:25:09\] Well I my view.

\[00:25:11\] I\'m in it because I love meeting great founders helping them and watching them be successful.

I get to meet people.

I get to meet these founders before they\'re famous.

And there is nothing more satisfying than giving advice to Mark Zuckerberg to Ben Silverman or Larry Page in the first two years of their existence and then watching them fly watching this rocket just like sitting watch the rocket ship take off and say wow I was part of that.

\[00:25:47\] I I I I put the first gas in the gas tank of that company.

So I think money fame fortune notoriety.

\[00:25:59\] That\'s all byproducts of of working your ass off.

\[00:26:04\] You know I noticed a similarity between the way you operate and what you look for in founders.

Right.

The founders aren\'t in it for the money either.

They\'re just trying to make this amazing product and the company\'s success as a byproduct.

Right.

You just Lig are super into these founders and ASV angel investing and all these companies with the biproduct.

\[00:26:22\] And that\'s that\'s why we all like each other.

Yeah.

It\'s so even though when they get an e-mail say much of them.

\[00:26:28\] But but we have we are kindred spirits does it help you think as an investor to have been a founder yourself.

\[00:26:38\] For sure for sure because because I know how hard it is.

\[00:26:44\] So if I hadn\'t founded a company myself I wouldn\'t feel like I had as much credibility.

\[00:26:51\] Well I\'m more does it help you pick people because you were literally looking for kindred spirit.

\[00:26:56\] Yes yes it does yes it does because because you can say hey will this person work 24/7.

Is this person a good communicator or will they follow through so here\'s a question.

\[00:27:10\] If someone if a founder was going to fool other investors but not fool you because you had been a founder yourself and you could recognize kindred spirits.

What would this founder be like.

What are the kinds of founders that would fool other investors but not fool you.

What do you not fall for.

\[00:27:30\] Well I\'m going to go back to the to the to the focus on the product.

I see.

\[00:27:35\] And so if they don\'t care a little too much about the product correct then that that\'s a warning sign that that trait 10 year ok I\'ve been doing this for 20 years.

\[00:27:48\] That trait didn\'t start pinging in my brain until like 10 years ago.

And then five years ago it became an alarm be it could be because a lot of it probably Ben Silverman a similar one was probably the tipping point where that\'s all he cared about.

And then from pattern recognition I said wow that\'s all Larry cared about.

That\'s all Jack Dorsey cared about.

The and that\'s all Steve Jobs care and that\'s all.

\[00:28:22\] Yeah that\'s that\'s all these great people care about.

It\'s focus focus on the product.

There\'s a guy at Pinterest Tim Kendall.

I hope he has a hundred of these shirts because he wears the same shirt every single day of the year.

\[00:28:35\] He\'s the head of product there and it\'s a circle with the word focus and even when they have outside visitors who are like super important he will walk into the room with his focus T-shirt.

And he\'s not taking it off.

\[00:28:53\] But boy does that count.

\[00:28:59\] OK.

So you might think like you\'re trying to start a startup he\'s trying to start a business you should be business like.

Right.

And the lesson here is really you should focus almost too much on the actual product.

\[00:29:11\] Yeah because if you focus on the product obviously the only way to measure success of the product is users and you will keep tweaking that product until user growth starts to explode and then you jump for joy and go for billions of them.

\[00:29:32\] So you focus on the product and the business follows correct.

Okay.

\[00:29:39\] So what do young founders specifically get get wrong when they start companies if you if you see a young founder and you think oh my god that\'s such a newb mistake.

\[00:29:51\] These guys are you know these guys look promising but they\'re so young they\'re doing X right.

\[00:29:55\] What do young founders do wrong.

\[00:30:00\] I think it would be lying to yourself after you know you\'ve prototyped the products in the marketplace.

\[00:30:12\] It\'s not getting traction it\'s not admitting that guess what it\'s not working.

And it\'s great if the founder says Hey stop stop.

Stop the train.

This this idea is not working.

What we need to do to make this idea work because success is binary.

You are either successful or you\'re not.

Your product is getting traction or it\'s not.

It\'s not getting traction.

The sooner you admit that and start doing things about it the better off everybody\'s going to be.

\[00:30:47\] So they\'re too prone to remain in denial.

Correct.

And when they get older they\'ve learned to realize this warning signs of denial.

\[00:30:58\] It\'s true in many domains actually.

So just just being honest with yourself.

\[00:31:04\] What\'s funny is your team will recognize it and admit it before you.

But of course they would never discuss it with you.

So when you say hey guess what you call everybody in and have a come to Jesus meeting and say this is not working.

Everyone in the room in their heads is going oh my god.

\[00:31:24\] The founder knows this is awesome.

\[00:31:28\] This is awesome.

Now we\'re a team.

Now we can go do something about it.

And the founder thinks morale is going to go down as a result of this meeting when in fact morale explodes because the team says Jeezy\'s were in trouble.

\[00:31:47\] But we all know we\'re in trouble and we\'re all going to figure it out together.

Not the founder by themselves trying to figure it out.

\[00:31:55\] You know what that reminds me reminds me of what happens when you fire somebody you remain in denial about it for a long time.

Yes.

And you finally do it and you fire them and you think morale is going to go down and actually everybody is delighted because they know this morale goes up.

\[00:32:10\] I would say firings and layoffs you know if if you\'re running low on money you have to face the fact and you have to lay people off.

Well when you lay people off that is not a good thing for the people getting laid off.

But for the people who are remaining in your company they are saying wow my founder is here to survive.

And so we\'re not just going to spend the money to go out of business.

And when you lay people off you tend to lay off the deadwood you know and when Deadwood leaves a company morale explodes because the remaining people say wow we\'re not wasting money on them anymore.

I can work harder and take all those people\'s place.

\[00:33:00\] I just want to pause for a moment.

Is there anybody back there this clock here says 25.

Does that mean we are already.

\[00:33:07\] Hello Jessica.

Are we over.

Is that what that 25 means.

\[00:33:16\] Okay uprighted someone should be waving frantically.

We just got so excited talking about this stuff.

All right.

There\'s a lot to talk about.

Is there anything else we should talk about because we\'re already over.

\[00:33:32\] Hopefully you have gotten something out of this.

I\'ll be talking to Rob.
