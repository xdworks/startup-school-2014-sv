**Jessica Livingston Introduces Startup School SV 2014-8K1VXyoz7MQ.mp4**

\[00:00:03\] Good morning.

\[00:00:04\] Laughter Hello everyone welcome I\'m Jessica Livingston with Y Combinator to get started.

Now today\'s.

Special.

\[00:00:22\] Today is the 10th Startup School we\'ve ever done.

It\'s pretty amazing to think we\'ve been doing this for a decade.

Out of curiosity was anyone at the first like rainy muddy day at Harvard in 2005.

That\'s so cool.

Anyway we\'ve gotten as you can attest it\'s gotten much more higher production value we actually have this beautiful carpeting on the stage today.

So we\'re excited.

And we have a great lineup of speakers so thank you all.

I know a lot of you traveled here to come and I hope you have a great day.

\[00:01:00\] We\'re going to get started we have Ron Conway of Espey Angel as our first guest speaker and there three remarkable things about Ron.

First of all he knows everyone in and everything about the world of startup investing.

He was basically the first Internet investor so he knows a lot of stuff and he\'s also rare in that he\'s totally upstanding.

You can trust him implicitly and you can\'t really say that about all investors at all.

And lastly he works his butt off.

He does an unbelievable amount of work for the startups he funds most of which he\'s not able to even discuss.

But we\'re going to hope to get a few of his stories out of him today.

I\'m also delighted to announce that Paul Graham is making a guest appearance this morning to interview Ron.
