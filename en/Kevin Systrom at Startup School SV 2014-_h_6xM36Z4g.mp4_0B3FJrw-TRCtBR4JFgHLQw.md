**Kevin Systrom at Startup School SV 2014-\_h\_6xM36Z4g.mp4**

\[00:00:03\] Kevin thanks a lot for joining us today.

Absolutely.

Thanks for having me.

It\'s nice big crowd.

\[00:00:08\] Yes this is quite a few people.

Well we can just launch right in.

I guess you know the crazy thing about this audience right here is that there might be the next kind of really successful hotheads sitting there might be you might be the one person sitting next to you right now.

I guess a lot that I love to hear initially is like how did you even come to startups.

At what point did you realize this was something that you could do that you wanted to do.

\[00:00:40\] Well the first thing I\'ll say is I challenge that there might be a founder here in the audience that\'s going to do something big.

It\'s like the birthday paradox right.

There\'s absolutely the chance that someone in this room here today will be the CEO CTO founder of like one of the world\'s most changing companies in the next 10 years.

We live in a really special place where people get to work on ideas where failure is tolerated.

I mean if you travel overseas to other places there\'s a reason why Silicon Valley is so different.

And that\'s because failure is tolerated.

You asked me a question which is why did I end up getting up into the startup world.

I grew up in outside of Boston Massachusetts in a small town.

Very few people have heard of called Holliston.

And it was there that I realized that I loved doing lots of different stuff it\'s not that I loved technology.

It was that I loved doing lots of different stuff so I went to boarding school.

And I was the guy hanging a an antenna outside of my dorm room window to do a pirate radio station right.

Like I was designing flyers for dances.

I was deejaying like I just love doing a lot of different things.

And when I read required reading in school our junior year was this book called The New New Thing that Netscape Salga right.

I read that and I said to myself like this feels like an area of the world I can come to and be myself and do lots of different things and see what sticks.

So I was drawn.

I did a trip to Stanford just to see the school because I was interviewing at a bunch of East Coast schools.

I came to Stanford.

I was like there are palm trees.

It\'s beautiful.

And everyone loves working hard on really cool stuff.

And I remember it was one of those first beautiful days back in Massachusetts.

Like you know you go through the entire winter and it\'s gray.

For those of you from Massachusetts you know what I\'m talking about.

And you get to the first beautiful day and I was talking a specific school I won\'t name my name.

And there was like not a single person outside.

I just said to myself like I want to be in a place where people want to enjoy life but work hard too.

So Stanford was just like a natural.

That\'s what drew me to being out here and being kind of a little schizophrenic and how I treat different ideas and go from thing to thing.

\[00:02:57\] But that\'s kind of the ethos of an entrepreneur hired at Stanford you kind of started your first thing I was a class classified my side.

Is that right.

\[00:03:06\] Yeah.

As many people know and I\'m not sure how this has changed to date.

At Stanford and other schools but like no one has money.

And all you want to do is get a fridge for your room.

\[00:03:19\] Right.

And I\'m pretty certain that every single year someone starts the startup and I caught this trap too which is just like how do you allow students to trade goods at the beginning and end of the year and there\'s this interesting mismatch between like the end of the year.

People want to get rid of the stuff in the beginning of the year everyone wants to buy stuff.

So I sat down and I decided to teach myself Ruby on Rails and I was like this is going to be a really awesome skill so I learned that learned about databases and learned enough to be dangerous.

And this is like one of the lessons in entrepreneurship is that like you don\'t have to be the best but you have to be dangerous right.

You have to learn just enough to be dangerous.

\[00:03:59\] To build an idea concept it and show it to the world and then it turns out there are lots of other people including all 170 employees that work at Instagram who are much better at doing all that stuff than I am.

\[00:04:10\] But you\'d need to find people who can you know be drawn to the idea that you build and and then they end up taking it and and make any of it better.

\[00:04:18\] So I worked on a classified ad startup at Stanford called the trellised.

It was supposed to be like Craigslist but the tree is the same.

\[00:04:27\] It was a really terrible name.

I\'m not a morning out of the way.

Thank you everyone for laughing.

Laughter.

\[00:04:33\] So what\'s interesting though is I started it not at Stanford but actually while I was studying abroad in Florence.

So I love art history I love photography obviously so I\'d studied in Florence for three months and I remember we didn\'t have much to do after class because it was the winter it was cold.

I think the program had 12 students in it.

So you\'d go home to your host family and you\'d eat an awesome Italian dinner and then you\'d sit there without TV and you just say OK what do I want to do.

\[00:05:05\] So Wi-Fi really wasn\'t a thing in their building and I would have my laptop and I would literally just build this site at the time on my little.

\[00:05:14\] It was an eyeball look and what I would do is actually to ship code.

I would go outside of the apartment building down the street.

And like I remember specifically one day it was snowing it doesn\'t snow in Florence very often.

That\'s why I remember it it was snowing and I would go next to the public library line with my laptop until I got enough signal and I would like SYNC FPP to make the files go to the server and then I would send off all my emails promoting it to people back at Stanford.

So I was literally just trying to launch this thing from afar.

\[00:05:45\] There\'s so much you can learn from even launching the thing that you know a lot of people attempt but the actual action of getting it out there like that was probably the first first step to a lot of the other things that you did later.

\[00:05:59\] Yeah I think what probably helped to you is like the idea that I wasn\'t on the ground listening to whether or not people liked it gave me enough like ammunition and confidence to like keep working on it.

And then all I had it was like are people using this or not.

Not like what do they think about it and are they judging the idea but like are they using it.

And that\'s really important because what people tell you and how people act are very very different sometimes.

So the lesson I learned was not very many people were using it.

So we ended up like I ended up forming the idea more and to a like less of a overall Craigslist and more of it just a goods transfer.

\[00:06:38\] But again the other lesson here is sometimes it\'s not about the idea that you\'re working on but instead the skills that you\'re learning while you work on it and that really helped me not only learn to program but also like learned to market a consumer site to people.

And I mean colleges are probably the best form of marketing because everyone\'s interconnected and they talk all the time.

\[00:07:01\] An incredible amount of groundwork for Instagram started far earlier and your experiences with previous start ups and learning to code.

I totally agree.

Just being able to talk to your other founders be able to build something for other people.

It all starts early.

So from there I guess a lot of the people in this room are in college or are about to graduate.

Trying to figure out what their next move is.

And so you know talk us through what your mind where your mind was that when you were graduating what you were thinking kind of you know the first experiences right before during college and after college.

\[00:07:38\] Yeah I think everyone\'s experience is different.

First every.

Everyone in this room has to take the idea that there is a perfect next move and throw it out the window.

There aren\'t many windows in this room but throw it out the window.

Okay.

There\'s no perfect next move.

I had the privilege of going to a Marine base once and talking to Marines about how they plan their next move.

And there\'s this phrase called bias towards action that I really was taken to.

So the idea that you can spend all of your time thinking about what the perfect next move is trying to plan.

Am I going to work at Google.

Am I going to work at Microsoft.

Like which one.

Like am I going to work at McKinsey or Bain like trying to figure out all like the next perfect move and spending a tremendous amount of time trying to figure that out.

The Marines say you can spend all the time you want but by the time you\'ve figured it out you\'re dead.

Okay.

So like sometimes you need to make a tradeoff of what is the action I can take with the appropriate amount of information and risk to move because moving and progress is what gets us to the next step.

So for me I mean when I was in school trying to figure out what to do after college.

All of my friends were interviewing at investment banks and Bain and McKinsey and they were getting these offer letters with six figures and I was like oh I got six figures right out of college is crazy.

By the way it is.

\[00:09:07\] And laughter it is right.

I like for a guy that didn\'t take a startup for the sorry salary for the first two years of you know funning bourbon Sosh Instagram.

\[00:09:17\] It was like he was really Harring to think that people can have a stock such a salary out of college and you\'re gonna go like take not a great job that you\'re going to do something that\'s a little riskier.

It turns out and I mean don\'t quote me on this because your parents will kill me.

It\'s all going to be fine.

OK.

When I told my parents that I was going to go do a startup.

And I know we\'re all a bit older here.

But like you know when I told my parents I was going to do a startup there like What about health insurance.

And I was like it\'s a good point.

\[00:09:46\] What about the health insurance.

\[00:09:49\] So thank you parents for making me think of that.

So let\'s see here.

\[00:09:55\] It was scary.

But that bias towards action was like there is no perfect next move.

You just need to know that by moving and learning it all adds up that summation of your experience over the last years is what makes you like into the thing tomorrow.

That will be successful and it just takes trying and trying and trying again.

I mean Instagram like filter\'s came from a photography class that I took in Florence or my my photography teacher gave me a square format camera called a hoga.

It\'s this plastic camera that got kind of hip with hipsters and anyway handed it to me and he said you should use this.

And as we were developing the film he is like you know you can change the look of the image if you put these chemicals in the bath when you\'re developing the print.

And I was like interesting.

Say you put it in like the colors start changing to this interesting purple.

And I started thinking to myself like oh my god this is like also I do it on all my prints and every time I made a print every one of the people in that class were like the prints are so cool.

That idea laid dormant for like five years.

So every little experience you have.

You may not give credit to you but it turns out is super important for you know being foundational in your startup going forward and you\'ll end up kind of figuring out how it takes form in your startup going forward.

But each and every little experience adds up.

\[00:11:16\] So flash forward a few years.

Your uncropped effort Google kind of thinking about your next thing and you start talking to people about Lalan thinking about starting something maybe furtive sharing some or perhaps something around each 5.

The initial idea Ramban starts percolating like what was that like initially and how did you get your first co-founder entomb yet I\'m going to answer a slightly different question as I have a better story about that tiras.

\[00:11:44\] Which is that like I was working in marketing at Google and I had taken the marketing class are sorry marketing job even though I wanted to be technical against all the other jobs that I had offered.

\[00:11:57\] There were like two or three a couple at a startup one at Microsoft one to Google.

I took the lowest salary of anyone that like any of the offers that I had because I wanted to work in a specific job at Google.

I didn\'t care what job it was actually I just care that it was at Google and I would surround myself by amazing people.

That was the first lesson that I learned just like go to where the people are.

And like short term long term tradeoffs just go to where the people are being at Google and going to corp dev was an interesting move because I was like I want to be startups again.

I learned a lot about startups in school but I want to be back in the startup world.

And then 2008 happened and I\'m not sure how many people remember 2008 in this forum.

\[00:12:38\] But the economy kind of went to crap and I remember looking at my boss and being like okay so like can we buy this companies like no.

Can we buy this company.

No one of them an IOU even named the name but it was a really interesting company ended up doing really well I wish we had purchased it.

But the thing is he was like we\'re actually not going to do many deals now.

\[00:12:57\] You should probably just go golfing and for like a 20 something year old thinking of themselves like I want to make a difference in the world and your bosses telling you to go golfing like maybe I should just leave.

So I did.

And I actually there\'s a chapter in between Google and bourbon that not many people know about but I ended up joining a startup of some Google folks called next stop which is like hugely transformational for me because that\'s where I cut my teeth learning to program learning to build a you know a site.

And everything I learned in that year at next stop before starting bourbon was actually like it made me ready to go do Werben.

So again every move you think needs to be perfect it turns out just like surround yourself by great people where you can learn the most and great things will happen.

But I didn\'t go golfing and that\'s rule number two.

\[00:13:50\] So bourbon was initially in a small five location sharing kind of app.

And I guess how did you come to that.

At what point did you come up with how five is kind of a new thing that\'s happening.

Let\'s link that to the other thing that I also really want you know what was.

How did that come about.

\[00:14:11\] I have this think I\'m sure it exists in other people\'s minds as well.

But it\'s called combinatorial entrepreneurship.

So just like take a bunch of terms that are hot and swap them around until you get something that\'s interesting.

\[00:14:22\] It was like HMO five check ins badges points.

Some of these guys right to say said ok no it\'s ok.

I mean listen it ended up being Instagram eventually.

\[00:14:31\] But Charles we got there.

\[00:14:38\] It\'s a great way to generate ideas.

But bourbon itself was like okay I don\'t actually.

It\'s funny.

I remember pitching to Andreessen Horowitz and being like aged 0 5 the future and they\'re like we totally agree.

And I\'m thinking in my head like I just don\'t know how to make iPhone apps so I\'m going to make it in age five laughter.

\[00:14:59\] So it worked out for me.

\[00:15:02\] But that ended up being like really important for a development cycle was which was like we were able to iterate really really quickly and like launch new features because it was aged Hammell.

And then the idea was like okay no one\'s using this thing because it\'s really slow and it\'s aged him out and they can\'t put Nikon on their screen or when they do it\'s really hard to.

So we knew we had to go native but we didn\'t know when and out back and yeah we had the back end exactly.

So when we decided to do Instagram what we did was we took bourbon and we said OK.

No one\'s using this thing.

What do we do.

Or rather what are people using.

\[00:15:37\] So you tell actually by the way like how many Absolut users or retention metric like data.

\[00:15:43\] It\'s really easy to select count star on users or whatever and it returns 80 approach guy protip Yeah it was really easy to tell how users laughter.

\[00:16:00\] Side note the day that it got really interesting and Instagram was when that craze stopped returning because there was a day where like I was like Mike how many users do we have.

And he was like Ed this command isn\'t returning.

\[00:16:14\] That\'s a good sign.

That\'s a good sign you\'re doing well.

Totally.

\[00:16:19\] But yeah.

Now there are tons of tools like to measure daily actives and courts and that stuff and that was just something that I mean it was kind of our own ignorance that didn\'t allow us to do that initially.

But it kept us focused on just building stuff.

But anyway we had bourbon and it was a location sharing app you could check in.

And as part of your Chaykin you can attach a photo or a video and you know there were points and badges and achievements and all sorts of stuff and I had like all the game theory books on my desk and I was like OK how can we game ify this thing.

And I was on this vacation because like it wasn\'t working I needed to clear my head.

My girlfriend and I went on this vacation in Mexico.

And we\'re walking along the beach and I\'m like Nicole I think like you know photos are kind of interesting.

Mike and I had talked and we were like the photos part seems like it\'s what people love the most.

And she was like Yeah.

But you know I don\'t like posting photos because like they\'re not that great.

And I was like What do you mean they\'re not that great.

And she goes well your friend Greg always takes amazing photos.

I was like well that\'s because he uses Hipstamatic in camera bag and she\'s like what.

And I was like well you know he uses apps that filter your photos and they oppose him.

\[00:17:24\] She goes oh you should add that laughter to your girlfriend.

Yes.

Laughter.

\[00:17:34\] So actually that day she was like You should add that I start to think I\'m like you know like maybe she\'s right maybe there\'s something there.

So I went home while not home we were staying in this little bed and breakfast there was like you know there\'s like forty dollars a night or something it was like a hostel and it had dial up Internet.

And I like basically researched how to change the look of pixels in an image.

And I built the first filter that afternoon which is now called ex pro to which a lot of people love and use the first thought I was the first one.

And actually if you scroll all the way back to my feet in the first image you actually see X proto and a little Mexican dog at a taco stand because we were in Mexico and then how did Kalven happen exactly.

\[00:18:12\] Let\'s not get into that.

\[00:18:14\] Well so here\'s the thing we did Felder\'s but that wasn\'t the end of the story we had to come back and we cut a bunch of the features and we made it native.

And I was like alright let\'s launch this thing.

And it took us about eight weeks to build the first version of Instagram and we launched it.

And like I don\'t know like the first day we had 25000 people sign up and then it just started it just like it never stopped.

It just kept going and going and going and I remember leaning over to my Cofan.

I was like Mike I think like this is going to be something like to know.

I mean he\'s the Pesa not the pessimist he\'s the pragmatist and the co-founder paire and I\'m like you know disillusion is like optimist like I\'d like to really dig in on that because I\'m literally one of the best launches that any app even today has seen.

\[00:19:03\] You know how did how did you end the year that you had such an incredible amount of support from the right people.

You were featured all these things like how did how do people get there.

\[00:19:13\] Yeah.

First of all.

Like great hiring for your company is it starts well before you need people.

You know I worked at a company called Odeo back in the day and my first day I showed up and I sat down at my intern desk and they they\'re like we\'d like to introduce you to the new engineer.

His name is Jack Dorsey and he sits down and like these are the types of stories we\'re like you just meet people along the way and the Valley is really small.

By the way the valley is smaller than this room.

The people you will meet.

Time and time again in the valley are probably in this room right now and you will meet them in one job and then another and then another.

And like the relationships we\'ve built over time helped us when we got to the point of launching where we\'re like hey can you use this thing and like tweeted out maybe my thing is there and I say no but actually they loved it so much so not only do they have to love it but then they also have to be willing to do you know promotion for it because they\'re your friends because you have a previous relationship.

But like we created so much buzz up until our launch that like once we launched it was this grounds.

Is this groundswell and the other thing is be relentless.

OK the one thing everyone\'s going to tell you is that your idea is bad and it\'s never going to work.

Do you know why.

Because 99 percent of ideas don\'t work.

And if someone says they\'re not going to work they\'re generally look right and because they\'re generally right they convince themselves that no ideas work.

But it turns out you have to be your own advocate.

You have to believe that it\'s going to work.

I remember saying to some people that were helping us with press I\'m going to talk to Claire Kane at the New York Times.

Now you are right about Instagram.

This is prelaunch.

And there were like There\'s no way you\'re gonna get her to write about Instagram like Google is her beat.

Like she doesn\'t write about little startups like you like like okay I\'m going to do it and they\'re like don\'t do it.

I was like Alright I\'m going to do it.

And I emailed her and sure enough she emails right back and she\'s like sure I\'ll come over and see what you guys are doing.

She writes this awesome article our first day of launch and like that was super helpful but it just turns out that like you have to be your own advocate because because no one else is incentivized to believe that your idea is going to work.

So you absolutely have to believe or like no one else is going to vote.

\[00:21:30\] Taking a step back right before lunch like Shirley just like anyone else you had crazy prelaunch jitters.

How did you know that it was ready for other people to try.

\[00:21:41\] So lesson ember three and startups we launched at midnight I remember is twelve thirtya.m.

October 6 and I press the button on the app store and back then when you press the button in the App Store Your assumption is like this is going to take a while it\'s probably not going to go out to the public instantly people started signing up.

I was like wait what 30 who is up like installing apps right.

Alec no one knows about this.

It turns out somewhere else in the world it\'s like midday laughter.

\[00:22:12\] So like we weren\'t exactly the smartest group laughter.

\[00:22:17\] So like what ended up happening is like the first giant set of users on Instagram we\'re all like from not China but like Asia a bunch of like German users were signing up and we looked at the e-mail addresses and like Hotmail Doddy and we\'re like why are all these German users signing up and we\'re like Oh because it\'s like you know 9:00a.m.

they\'re like people are actually awake.

So what ended up happening was a ton of people signed up.

We were on a single server at a small little colo facility down inL.A.

that you could rent a physical server that was like I remember someone saying to me like why are you guys on one server like why don\'t you just useA.W.

And I was like What\'s AWOL.

\[00:22:59\] Laughter.

You all laugh.

But it wasn\'t obvious at the time.

\[00:23:04\] And when we launched it\'s like we little tiny server which is like had half of the power of an iPad like basically couldn\'t keep up.

And we called them and were like hey we need another server I think and they\'re like another server I\'m like yes.

One more server Lee is there.

\[00:23:21\] Laughter I\'m like that\'ll be four days.

\[00:23:25\] And we\'re like no we need at Rusciano like okay well four hours work and we\'re like no.

Like we need it.

Now we\'re launching like everyone\'s Candy.

So when all the press hit a 9am and everyone started tweeting like first of all never watch Twitter when you launch because it\'s like really demoralizing everyone\'s boobs.

Like they don\'t know what they\'re doing.

And I literally thought to myself like we have this great idea but like no one loves it because like we\'re down and actually one of the guys at the coworking space like told us like took a picture on Instagram of a boss trying to keep the site up and tried posting it.

\[00:24:00\] It\'s frame somewhere.

I\'m not totally.

You can actually it\'s Aaron Gottwald.

Thank you Erin.

Calling them out by name in front of seventeen hundred people.

Yeah.

\[00:24:09\] But yeah we there were jitters but it was more adrenaline than anything it was like how do we keep this thing up.

Like how do we make sure that it doesn\'t topple.

I still think we I mean if you ask many entrepreneurs and very few will tell you that they think they were lucky.

I think we\'re really lucky to know the right people to be in the right place at the right time to have devices progressed to the point where like people wanted to take photos but didn\'t want to take photos unless you did something to them like we were at the right place right time with the right team.

And I feel forever lucky for that.

But I mean it takes a lot of hard work once you\'re lucky.

\[00:24:43\] Kind of a big closing question because Instagram is not nearly technology it\'s also an incredible community.

While you\'re on your way up how did you preserve that.

How did you think about that.

You know me that something like that is happening on their own.

How did that happen.

What are our values internally by the way when you get big you start writing down your values on pieces of paper and you put them everywhere to make sure that people understand what your values are and one of them like our first value is.

\[00:25:12\] Community First.

And what that means is our community is our greatest asset.

Anyone in the world and by the way anyone can and did build a filter app.

You see tons of filter apps you see tons of people making photos social networks.

But the one thing that\'s really hard to build is a community and like we started with a very small community of designers and photographers that were close friends that we knew that loved what we were building and we scaled it from there but we never took our eye off the fact that the most important thing to remember is that your users are your greatest asset the people that spend time every single day using your service are your greatest asset.

If you alienate them if you take advantage of them.

If you over Monitise them right etcetc.

You end up like losing the soul of what you build.

Because anyone can build earlybird Kalvin expert too.

Like that\'s not hard.

You can read on Stack Overflow about it right but you can\'t build a community from scratch easily and it took a lot of hard work.

It took a lot of insta meets it took a lot of in fact our first hire was not an engineer it was a community manager.

We were like we have this great group of people that need to like understand that we\'re here to work for them.

We\'re serving them.

They\'re not serving us.

They\'re not like our we are serving them like we did that from day one.

And I think it really really helped.

And still to this day around our office you see posters that just say community first.

And I think it\'s been probably one of our greatest advantages is that focus on the people that use our service.

\[00:26:47\] And you\'re still doing it still doing it.

Kevin thank you so much for taking the time.

Also.
