**Danae Ringelmann at Startup School SV 2014-QPbHf4i6CrQ.mp4**

\[00:00:02\] First of all this is totally awesome.

\[00:00:06\] I want everybody to actually take a minute a moment of silence and appreciate the fact that you\'re here and appreciate the fact that your whole life has been leading to this point you might all be thinking that I\'m about to embark on this journey of startup ville and entrepreneurship but there\'s a reason you\'re sitting in this room and your story has already started.

So \[00:00:32\] I want to share my story with you and what I hope you realize is that there\'s bigger meaning behind you just wanting to learn a couple tips and tricks of how to be a great entrepreneur.

There\'s a bigger mission behind all of that in you and I hope you all take a moment after today to think through that and appreciate that it\'s already there.

So I\'m going to talk today about building what matters.

I\'m one of the founders of any gogo.

My journey started pretty much when I was a kid and I\'ll talk about that in a second.

But we launching we Gogo back in January 2008.

My two cofounders and I and today we\'re now the largest global online funding platform in the world helping entrepreneurs artists causes activists.

You name it you want to raise money for it.

People are using it.

Every country every industry to go after their dreams to make it happen.

But like I said my story didn\'t start in January 2008 when I decided to start a company.

\[00:01:28\] My story started actually when I was a kid which is why I want you guys all to reflect on your own stories and where you\'ve come from and why you\'re sitting here today.

I was such daughter of two small business owners in San Francisco.

They were running a brick and mortar business and for 30 years they struggled because they could never get outside loan they could never get access to capital.

No one would actually give me a loan from a bank or whatever to help grow their business.

\[00:01:55\] And so they technically bootstrapped for 30 years which sounds like hell in the venture capital world but that\'s what they did.

And their story is like every other small business owner out there trying to make it happen every day.

\[00:02:07\] But in watching them persevere and figure it out and you know cut their salaries when when the economy crashed and September 11th happened all that kind of stuff.

Watching all that actually grew very aware of a very big problem and that problem with access to capital.

Why was it so hard to find money and raise money.

Go do what you want to go do in the world that actually led that awareness led me to Wall Street.

I\'ve got my first job in New York City.

Super excited.

In corporate finance investment banking how many people in that life.

\[00:02:41\] Yeah.

Raise your hand proud.

\[00:02:44\] Yeah I\'ve been there.

Great training ground but it was one of those weeks where I was working 100 hours a week and I got invited to this event called where Hollywood meets Wall Street.

\[00:02:54\] And I was working in the entertainment group so because the word Wall Street was in the title I thought I could justify it to my boss to go.

But really I was just an excuse to get out of the office.

And at this event where Hollywood meets Wall Street was happening.

I was like what I was expecting to happen was meeting a sea of Hollywood producers talking to these Wall Street bankers and I\'d be this fly on the wall listening to what they\'re actually saying and actually learning what how this business works.

But the exact opposite happened when I got there was about a room this big fall like it is today and I literally was the most popular girl at the party.

Why.

It was a sea of emerging artists all hoping to meet their next angel.

\[00:03:35\] I was the one naive person from a bank that decided to show up and I was 22.

\[00:03:43\] But what hit me though was I was little kind of overwhelmed by what hit me it was two days later when one of the filmmakers that had met that that night went through the effort and actually paid fifteen dollars to FedEx me his script and in his script he said it was wonderful to me today.

I look forward to financing my next film and that\'s when my heart sank because here I was a newbie investment banking analyst.

I didn\'t control any money.

I ran spreadsheets I put pitch decks together.

That\'s what I did.

But here is a man with a lifetime of experience begging me someone was pretty much no experience for money simply because I worked at a bank and that\'s when everything kind of came crashing down.

My idealism came crashing down in that moment and I did what any young girl does when you\'re really pissed off and distraught about something you call your mom and I did it for the next 30 minutes I cried on the phone and talked about how unfair this world was how America is not the land of all possibility.

\[00:04:45\] It\'s only the land of possibility for the lucky few that are connected and my mom who\'s very busy running her business quietly and patiently waited.

And when I finally exhausted myself she\'d she inserted and said well that pissed off about it.

\[00:05:00\] Just go do something about it.

She hung up on me.

\[00:05:05\] So I did.

I started working with some of those filmmakers and theater producers on the site trying to help them raise money and then I started to fail and fail miserably and the biggest failure of all was when I helped a theater producer that I had met that night try to raise money for a play an Arthur Miller play called incident of Vichy which was a play about racial profiling.

Now this is right after September 11th in New York City.

So I thought this is it.

This is the topic.

And so for months I worked with him we we rented out a venue about the size of this pacta with an audience like this.

Got actors to volunteer their time even Richard Dreyfus signed up.

\[00:05:41\] I hustled to get investors there and the whole point of the night was to do a concert reading a one time showing of this play with a goal that those investors are so impressed by the whole night that they\'ll whip out their checkbooks and cut a check and fund the full production of the play and odd I\'d be on to a new career as a as an Off Broadway theater producer everything went perfect except that last little bit which was the investors turned to me and they said oh my god that was an amazing play.

\[00:06:08\] The audience was uproar it was awesome and they turned and they said that was amazing.

We\'re not investing.

\[00:06:14\] Good luck.

All of it for nothing.

I was lost my job because Arthur Miller was faxing me at work.

All of it for nothing.

\[00:06:22\] And it was actually in that moment that I realized that the reason they didn\'t want to take a risk on me as I was a nobody I didn\'t have a track record on Broadway.

\[00:06:32\] And it was in that moment though that I realized that if my parents and this elderly filmmaker who had had a lifetime of experience taught me that finance was broken it was this experience that showed me how it was broken and how it was broken.

\[00:06:46\] Was that the people who wanted this play to come to life the most which in this case were the actors and the audience.

They together did not have the power or mechanism to make it happen.

And they were completely dependent on these third party gatekeepers or decision makers or investors.

\[00:07:04\] To define their destiny and their reality so that pissed me off and that\'s what sent me back to business school.

I quit finance came up with an idea on how to democratize access to capital.

I went back to Berkeley to start this business.

And it\'s there that I met my cofounders and we launched it and today Indiegogo is now the largest online funding platform in the world.

We started before the word crowdfunding even existed.

\[00:07:28\] And so it all sounds nice and perfect but it\'s eight years later and I\'ve learned a ton.

Along the way I failed a ton along the way and what I want to do is kind of share some of the lessons learned because you guys are about to embark on this part of your journey your journey has already began.

But now it\'s time to execute.

And if I can it\'s still just a couple nuggets of insight set you guys up for success.

I want to do that.

\[00:07:55\] So the first is no you\'re Y.

And what I mean by this is why are you starting this company.

\[00:08:03\] What problem are you trying to solve.

And why do you care so much.

If it\'s not if your reason for being is not authentic to your core chances of you were of you failing we\'ll actually go way up.

\[00:08:16\] And the reason why is for me my why was I wanted to democratize access to capital.

I was aware of this problem affected my parents.

It was now affecting me because I can help the people I wanted to help.

And so my wife became I want to democratize access to capital.

And the reason it was so important and the reason why it was so helpful is actually my wife found me my cofounders.

It\'s a hard that\'s a hard journey to figure out who should you partner with.

But when you\'re clear why you\'re doing this and you spew it to the world the people who care about that to join you and because I was viewing it over and over again.

I was actually able to find my co founders in business school.

The second thing is that your wife gets you out of your way to my original idea was a complete offline fund with a Democratic twist.

Not at all what Indiegogo is today.

And when I met my co founders and they were asking me what my real goals are here and that was to democratize access to capital.

\[00:09:09\] Slava my co-founder is turning me said well if you really want to do that why aren\'t you using the Internet.

\[00:09:14\] And I said that is the amazing point.

It is the most democratic tool out there.

You can\'t invest online but that actually led us to coming up with a perks space model innovating pivoting and because of that we\'re able to launch into Gogo and I say that because if if I was more obsessed with the solution of my original idea of what of the product in the solve that I had in mind I would have been stuck on that but because I was more obsessed with my wife and actually solving a bigger problem I didn\'t care how I solved it.

I just wanted to solve it.

And that allowed me to see a better way to solve it.

Another reason to focus on your why is it it gets you through those dark periods which there will be dark periods.

I like to show this graph because on top was our plan we launched January 2008 raise our first venture around fall of 2008 and then be off to the races.

We all know what happened in the fall of 2008.

Things did not go according to plan.

Fast forward three and a half years we finally raised that first round of capital.

So that was three years longer than we actually anticipated.

I had planned to not take a salary for one year.

I ended up having to survive for four.

\[00:10:19\] It\'s just the reality.

But if you\'re.

Why is not totally you.

If it\'s not totally powerful and meaningful to you you won\'t stick out that you won\'t stick it out.

Entrepreneurship is just too hard.

\[00:10:36\] Our first employee Erika turned to us when we hired her in 2011 after we raised our round of capital first round.

She kind of looked at our numbers and shot.

\[00:10:44\] She saw that we were always growing but we not we didn\'t really have that hockey stick growth until the prior couple months right before we raised our round and she looked at her number she said Wow you guys really did stick it out.

\[00:10:55\] Why.

And my co-founder Eric said Well we were passionate about what we were doing despite reason.

\[00:11:01\] And that sums it up you have to be passion about what you\'re doing despite reason you\'re why also informs your whole strategy.

\[00:11:10\] So it\'s actually a very practical thing it gives you bump Galanes for how you\'re going to execute.

We\'re an open platform because we want to empower the world and allow everybody to matter to them to actually empower the world.

We can\'t be a gatekeeper ourselves.

We can\'t have an application system.

So that\'s why we\'ve been an open system since the very beginning and that\'s continuing to be the reason why people use this everyday.

It also made us be global from the get go which is another reason people use us everyday if we want to truly empower the world we have to be everywhere in the world and that force us to do the hard work to to create the backend infrastructures that we could serve every customer in every country across the world.

It also informs your strategy so we realize that we\'re doing something completely new.

We are reinventing a whole new industry called funding and a new way to actually raise money.

And so because of that this was a new experience for most people in the world that that allowed us to focus on actual customer happiness being a key driver of our business.

And now a key differentiator people uses every day because we help you the most because oftentimes when people raise money this way it\'s the first time they\'ve ever done it.

And the why also continues to inform your strategy and how you actually build your product.

So again we want to empower everybody to find what matters to them and everybody to raise money.

That\'s what democratizer ization of capital means to us.

And so with that you need to have all kinds of funding options.

You can\'t just do it one way or the other and say it\'s our way or the highway you have to give people options so they can maximize their experience and optimize it for their specific needs.

So we have fixed finding flex funding forever funding all kinds of different kinds of funding structures so that people can be successful and one day we\'re actually part of the jobs act happening.

One day we\'ll be able to offer equity crowdfunding when the laws change which we actually helped change as well.

And the coolest thing about having a really good why though is it attracts amazing people.

\[00:13:04\] The best talent out there can go anywhere.

They\'re not looking for jobs they\'re happy where there are.

But what will make them change their situation is if there\'s a company that actually allows them to do what they believe is right and do what\'s important to them.

\[00:13:20\] And because of that we\'ve had an amazing experience attracting the most amazing people who are not just their skills aren\'t just out of out of control good but their hearts are as well and they are so motivated.

But for this mission of democratizing access to capital they continue to innovate every single day to help us achieve our mission.

And lastly and this is the coolest part is your y actually attracts your customers.

\[00:13:49\] Amazing customer.

So we\'ve had customers like young or you know engineers out to Idaho not connected to any university or anything but they\'re just passionate about saving the world by creating solar powered streets and roads across across the world.

They used to be getgo additive raising over two million dollars to bring their idea to life.

And then this is one of my favorite ones you buy home.

This is awesome team of folks who are micro crowdsourcing your your genome or your bio.

Excuse me they got started because they were able to validate their market gauge interest on Indiegogo by raising thier threatener fifty thousand dollars.

\[00:14:27\] They then got into Y Combinator and now because of all of this traction success they just close their series.

million Series C.

So what\'s happening is we\'re giving all kinds of cool opportunities all kinds of ideas ideas that maybe the world would have passed over had they not had a chance to actually see see them bubble up and thrive.

So the question is how do you guys get clarity on your why.

Well not to be Medha here.

There\'s a very simple exercise I learned in business school which is the five y exercise which is start with a statement.

Why are you doing to the company that you want to start and.

Explain that to yourself and then ask yourself like a two year old would.

Why again and then why again and keep going until you get to a place where you\'re totally irrational where you\'re just explaining the reason you\'re doing this is because of a belief and when you get to that kind of irrational place that means you have something really real there and for us my why was I wanted to democratize funding.

Well why do I care about that.

Well it\'s because finance is broken and inefficient and it\'s due to this reliance on gatekeepers.

Why is the reliance on key gatekeepers not good.

Well because it doesn\'t allow for equal opportunity.

So why is equal opportunity important.

Because I\'d feel like life should be fair so why should life be fair.

I just believe it.

\[00:15:43\] It\'s just what I believe.

\[00:15:45\] It\'s irrational.

It\'s just what I believe.

And that was so core to me that that was the reason why I knew I was onto something and that I need to stick with it.

So do that exercise the second second lesson we learned is to be intentional with your culture.

So culture is is it\'s this big amorphous word that people like to throw around.

All it is is who is who you are and how and how you are.

It\'s the people within You\'re within your team and it\'s how you behave.

Every single day.

And the biggest mistake I see my fellow entrepreneurs making is this they always put culture 11th on their top 10 priority lists.

\[00:16:24\] Literally it\'s always important.

But it never makes the cut.

I was actually at a dinner with some fellow entrepreneurs a few months or years ago and this is exactly what he said.

There was a fellow entrepreneur who said it\'s so important.

It means everything it actually determines whether we\'re successful or not.

But I I never I never can get to it.

And I said Oh you\'re getting to it.

There is a culture.

It is happening no matter what.

No matter whether you want to admit it or not you\'re just not being intentional about it.

So who knows what kind of culture you\'re building if you\'re actually setting yourself up for success.

So the key is to make it a priority and for us we\'ve had we\'ve made the kind of people we attract a priority.

Diversity.

There\'s so much research out shows that diversity drives are why innovation.

If you\'re trying to change the world you\'re trying to build something really meaningful in this world which I hope all of you guys are thinking about doing.

You need the best ideas the most diverse ideas the most diverse perspectives to actually get there.

Because if you don\'t have that you\'re going to a group think you\'re gonna fail.

And because of this we\'ve actually done a pretty good job.

We\'re over almost 50 percent women and an ego go over 30 percent of our engineers are women.

\[00:17:32\] Also very excited.

\[00:17:36\] We have more work to do on the ethnic side.

But again it\'s back to a diversity of perspectives backgrounds experiences.

\[00:17:42\] All of that is incredibly important for you setting up so if you\'re a one person team right now or two person team this is the perfect time to be thinking about this and going out and finding partners and team members who are nothing like you who think differently because you by doing that one thing you will set yourself up for success.

The second thing is that culture again it\'s it\'s not it\'s just it\'s who you are and it\'s how you act.

It\'s how you are everyday how you act.

And I actually don\'t believe in this concept that there\'s good cultures and bad cultures there\'s just strong cultures and cultures and want a strong culture is a culture where the values and behaviors that the people exhibit and embody everyday are the values and behaviors that the company needs its people to exhibit everyday to win.

Very simple.

And so how do you know what values and behaviors you need.

You need to to have to win.

What starts with you.

The founders.

And it\'s not like this big heady theoretical exercise.

It\'s actually an exercise of distillation of self revealing or self reflection.

And so the way we got there to our values at least is I made all my co-founder and I sit down around the table and in five minutes Drost six pictures that answer the question I love coming to work at IndieGoGo because literally I learn that moment in time.

My co-founder and I were terrible drivers and that design was going to be a key skill set.

They were going to need to fill as soon as possible.

But what it actually revealed is that my cofounders and I in our early team all can work for the same for reasons and for us what your reasons might be different but for us the reasons we came to work everyday as the first was we wanted to change industry in changing an industry that had never been changed.

That got us excited.

I got us motivated and that\'s where fearlessness came from.

The second reason we all came to work everyday.

We wanted to bring our whole selves to work.

You don\'t have to be anybody else.

Put on a metaphorical union uniform or a real uniform.

We just wanted to be ourselves.

And that\'s where authenticity came from.

The third reason was Whoops let me go back.

Sorry.

The third reason was we all wanted to work with people that we had and build something together.

So we work.

All of us were team sport people in high school in college.

None of us were solo acts.

We like to actually we liked environments where two plus two equals five that got us excited.

So collaboration became our third value and the fourth was we all wanted to spend our waking lives helping people that wanted to be helped.

You\'re at work a lot especially in the early days of a startup.

So for us what was super important is we wanted to be spending your energy helping people that wanted to be helped.

\[00:20:24\] Which is where empowerment came from.

\[00:20:27\] And so in the early days what fearlessness for example meant to us is you know being super opportunistic really finding our way this idea word of crowdfunding didn\'t exist so we didn\'t know if we were onto something or not.

But the next thing we did and we actually just did this a year ago is we actually define the behaviors.

Now today that really embody fearlessness so as we started to grow we realized that someone\'s definition of fearlessness over here was different from somebody else\'s definition of fearlessness.

And while we had been higher when we started hiring people we did skills interviews and put out that kind of stuff but we always did culture interviews which is to make sure that people\'s values and behaviors were aligned with the companies.

And what we\'ve done is we\'ve over time you have to continue to revisit these behaviors and so today what fearlessness means to us is ruthlessly prioritizing.

It\'s people who say no to the less important things because we now have so many opportunities.

It could easily could easily be that we lose our focus and that will actually kill our chance of actually democratizing access to capital.

Same thing with awesome authenticity in the early days it really meant bring your whole self to work today because we are such a diverse team and we\'re our customers.

Everyone across the world.

What really matters now and being authentic as some is is we\'re being respectful of different points of views.

And so we\'ve identified this.

And one thing I should say is while you want a diversity of people and backgrounds and experiences which is where I started what you don\'t wanted diversity of is your values and behaviors because that\'s the glue that keeps everybody together.

And then what you do with this is when you\'ve clarified your values and any favors you actually operationalize it and you reinforce it through you screen everybody in your hiring process for it.

I promise you this kind of sounds nuts and bolts.

But is so critical because then you actually hire absolutely amazing people people that are not only off the charts with their skills but also off the charts with their alignment with with your mission you operationalize it how you get stuff done and how you reward and recognize.

\[00:22:30\] So every quarter we have an all hands which here here\'s one.

But we give out IGIS and Wiggins Aigis our awards for people who completely embody our values.

Twiggy\'s are of course for people that make us laugh but it stands for whops IGIS.

Aigis or something from the top down Aigis are given out by all of us.

\[00:22:52\] So I go on I give other people Aigis based on how I feel they\'ve embraced and embodied our values and it\'s very democratic in that way but it\'s also very real and it\'s very raw and it also reinforces the fact that culture is not a top down thing it\'s not something you can create only something you can influence as leaders and it takes the rest of the people in your team to continue to reinforce it as well.

But it has to start with you.

And then you can measure it.

Nothing would be good.

You\'re not a good Silicon Valley tech startup if you\'re not measuring yourself.

And so we do actually we measure ourselves of how intentional we are we are being with our culture and one way to do it is is measure our engagement and happiness.

So we do an employee survey which is how how likely are you to refer a friend to come work here similar to customer service.

What you probably learned about.

And then we also have rolled out OK here\'s which\'s productivity metrics How well are we actually getting the things that we want to get done.

Again a strong culture is a culture where people\'s values and behaviors that the company needs to win are the ones that people authentically embody every day.

And when people are themselves embodying the values of behaviors that they hold naturally they are more productive they are more happy.

\[00:24:04\] And so you\'re your execution and the company\'s results should actually show that alright.

\[00:24:11\] Lesson number three and have two more minutes.

\[00:24:16\] We\'re all here in the Valley.

We\'re all probably interested in technology were here interested in entrepreneurship.

\[00:24:22\] But one thing I\'ve learned in all of this is that technology is not the end.

It\'s simply a means to an end.

And if I look back and see how I got to where I am today starting from a young girl it wasn\'t like I said I want to be a technology entrepreneur.

One day what I did is I focused on my wife.

I focus on a problem that really bothered me at my core and I focus on that and I realized I wanted to fix something and to fix that starting a company would be the best way to do it.

So I actually became an entrepreneur because I had to.

And then I found technology is a solve because that was the best way to fix that.

And I think because I came to it that way we have the name and my co-founder and I have been able to build something truly truly meaningful that is really impacting the world changing the world making a lot of money and and growing it and literally changing the course of his work or changing history literally and changing the course of the future for all of finance and people across the world.

\[00:25:20\] And someone noticed that if you could play the video in the private sector stepping up as well from Indiegogo and Etsy to Disney and Intel companies have pledged to help unleash a new wave of innovation here in America.

These companies do different things.

They come from different industries but they share the belief that when we tap the potential of every American.

All of us are better off so this.

\[00:25:50\] Alone didn\'t ask him to say that.

\[00:25:53\] That was awesome.

When you have moments like that you remember them.

There\'s lots of ups and downs.

This is one of the apps along our journey.

And this was recently after we White House reached out we did a Maker Faire with them and he talked about this.

\[00:26:05\] But the point is those were included there not because again we hustled and hadn\'t had and say it it\'s because we actually built something meaningful worthy of talking about at that scale.

And actually one of the things that always I\'ll always remember is when we just raised a 40 million dollar round of capital a few months ago almost a year ago I guess now and.

\[00:26:29\] We were talking to Kleiner Perkins they were part of the round but before they had decided to invest Gondor came to me and he said regardless of whether or not we have the opportunity to invest in you you should know you\'ve built a really important company.

\[00:26:45\] The world as you guys sit here thinking about what you want to go build and what problems you want to go solve.

Don\'t think about how do I get really how do I get big fast that will happen.

If you actually build something super meaningful and super important you don\'t think about you know what is the quickest way to success.

Think about what is the best way to building something important that the world really needs.

And when you do that you have customers like this and this is a campaign that just went live.

We\'re literally unleashing another catalyst tool of IT organization that will unleash even more people to go into technology.

The Hour of Code they just launched their campaign this week.

They\'re raising five million dollars.

Reid Hoffman who is about to come speak has committed to matching with Bill Gates and Microsoft.

Salesforce are matching2.5 million dollars if the people can raise two and a half million dollars for an Hour of Code and the goal is to bring coding to 100 million people across the world.

That is something you guys can do today if you want to be part of that you can fund that campaign.

And after that I want you all to go home and think about your why thinking about how do you attract people who think differently than you.

\[00:28:02\] And also think about how technology is just your tool and your mechanism for making change.

It\'s not be the end goal in itself but with that I think you.

Apply.
