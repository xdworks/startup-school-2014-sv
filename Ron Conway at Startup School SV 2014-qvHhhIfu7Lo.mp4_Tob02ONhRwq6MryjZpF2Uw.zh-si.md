**Ron Conway at Startup School SV 2014-qvHhhIfu7Lo.mp4**

*2014年创业学校SV-qvHhhIfu7Lo.mp4*

\[00:00:02\] He\'s back for a day or an hour.

[00：00：02]他回来了一天或一小时。

\[00:00:07\] There\'s lights behind that thing.

[00：00：07]那东西后面有灯。

OK.

好的

\[00:00:11\] So I interviewed Ron on this stage were on stage at Startup School in 2012 and the videos on YouTube.

[00：00：11]所以我采访了这个舞台上的罗恩，2012年他在创业学校的舞台上，还有YouTube上的视频。

\[00:00:22\] Ron told a lot of the good stories then so I\'m not going to ask him about that stuff.

[00：00：22]罗恩讲了很多好故事，所以我不想问他那些事。

\[00:00:28\] But Ron has an infinite supply of for anybody if there\'s anybody out there who doesn\'t know who run Connolly is basically just remember this sentence.

[00：00：28]但是罗恩对任何人都有无限的供给，如果有人不知道谁在运行康诺利，基本上记住这句话。

Ron Conaway is the man now not in the sense of like working for the man not that man that man.

现在，罗恩·柯纳维不是那种为男人工作的人，而不是那个人。

The other man.

另一个人。

He is like the investor.

他就像投资者。

I told Weiss startups just this blanket advice if Ron Conway wants to invest in you take his money.

我告诉Weiss初创公司，如果RonConway想投资你，就接受他的建议。

So that\'s all you have to remember about Ron Conway a baby Laughter Why C is for creating laughter.

这就是你所需要记住的关于罗恩·康威，一个婴儿的笑声，为什么C是用来创造笑声的。

So Ron is famous for investing in founders.

所以罗恩以投资创始人而闻名。

And so I wanted to ask you when you say you invest in founders what that means is you invest in people with certain traits.

所以我想问你，当你说你投资于创建者时，这意味着你投资于具有某些特质的人。

Can those traits be acquired.

这些特质能被获得吗。

Or is it just the case that some people have it and some people don\'t.

或者仅仅是一些人拥有它，而有些人却没有。

Because these people are interested in starting startups right.

因为这些人对创业很感兴趣。

So I\'m going to try and get the stuff out of your brain.

所以我要试着把这些东西从你脑子里拿出来。

Blow it out onto the other.

把它吹到另一边。

That will be helpful to them without being sloppy.

这会对他们有帮助而不会草率。

\[00:01:49\] What I have said before entrepreneurs are born to be entrepreneurs.

[00：01：49]我之前所说的企业家生来就是企业家。

\[00:01:57\] Then once you\'re an entrepreneur you\'re a serial entrepreneur or you\'re probably going to start companies for the rest of your life or if you\'re like Zucker Larry Page you know it might be the only company you start but you are an entrepreneur for life.

[00：01：57]那么，一旦你成为了一名企业家，你就成了一个连续的企业家，或者你可能会在你的余生中创办公司，或者如果你像祖克·拉里·佩奇一样，你知道这可能是你唯一的创业公司，但你是一辈子的企业家。

And I think most entrepreneurs do correctly self select.

我认为大多数企业家的选择是正确的。

And I think that entrepreneurs are born have to be born with some of the basics.

我认为，企业家的诞生必须具备一些基本要素。

So which treats have to be in Born which can be learned so that the basics I think would be you have to have a hell of a work ethic.

所以，哪些治疗必须是天生的，这是可以学到的，所以我认为最基本的是，你必须有一种极高的职业道德。

You talked about it at your Stanford class.

你在斯坦福大学的课上谈过这件事。

You have to be ambitious.

你得野心勃勃。

You have to be aggressive and you have to be tough because starting a company is the hardest thing on earth to do.

你必须有进取心，而且你必须强硬，因为创办一家公司是地球上最难做的事情。

And I don\'t think people realize that until they do it.

我认为人们在做这件事之前不会意识到这一点。

Since I\'ve watched thousands of entrepreneurs do it I know how hard it is.

因为我看过成千上万的企业家这么做，所以我知道这有多难。

Plus I started my own company Alto\'s computer in the 70s so I know from personal knowledge how hard it is and I started another company of companies as well.

另外，我在70年代创办了自己的Alto电脑公司，所以我从个人的知识中了解到这是多么困难，我还创办了另一家公司。

And so you think the driven part has to be inborn for sure.

所以你认为驱动部分必须是与生俱来的。

You can\'t you can\'t learn to be ambitious and be driven.

你不能-学会野心勃勃和有动力。

Obviously you have to be curious you have to be intelligent.

显然，你必须好奇，你必须聪明。

I think being a founder is like it.

我觉得做创办人就像这样。

It\'s like a vocation but if you have those basic skills you know where you\'ve got where you\'re you\'re determined you\'re tough.

这就像一种职业，但如果你有这些基本技能，你就知道你在哪里，你已经下定决心，你是坚强的。

You have a huge work ethic.

你有很强的职业道德。

You\'re completely Reifel focused.

你完全集中注意力了。

Then there\'s other things that you that you have to learn you have to learn to hire a management team.

还有其他的事情，你必须学会雇用一个管理团队。

You have to learn how to manage these things you\'re not born with these things you have to want success so badly that you learn how to manage you learn how to find a management team.

你必须学会如何管理这些事情-你不是与生俱来的-你必须如此渴望成功，以至于你学会了如何管理，学会了如何找到一个管理团队。

You learn how to recruit people and then spread your vision and and motivate them to be just like you and be fanatical about your business.

你学会了如何招募人才，然后传播你的视野，激励他们和你一样，对你的事业保持狂热。

So \[00:04:20\] how can they tell.

所以[00：04：20]他们怎么知道。

How can these people you know it would save them a lot of trouble if you can tell them now whether they\'re gonna succeed in starting a startup how can they tell if they\'re driven enough.

这些你知道的人，如果你现在就告诉他们创业是否会成功，怎么能帮他们省下很多麻烦呢？他们怎么知道他们是否有足够的动力。

\[00:04:31\] Well well I mean are you willing to work 24/7.

[00：04：31]好吧，我是说，你愿意24小时工作吗？

The really great entrepreneurs are 24/7.

真正伟大的企业家是全天候的。

The word moonlighting is not even in their vocabulary.

兼职这个词甚至不在他们的词汇表中。

I mean if they\'re dating somebody or they\'re married they warn their spouse that they\'re not first in line that this company dream is first in line and that that you have this vocation.

我的意思是，如果他们在约会，或者他们结婚了，他们会警告他们的配偶，他们并不是第一人，他们的公司梦想是排在第一位的，而且你有这份职业。

You know it\'s like being a priest or a nun that that your duty is to your company.

你知道，你对公司的责任就像当牧师或修女一样。

Now it has to be that fanatical and if you look at all the successful entrepreneurs they are that committed about it.

现在，它必须是如此狂热，如果你看看所有成功的企业家，他们都致力于此。

That is a hard commitment.

这是一个艰难的承诺。

But once you\'re willing to make that commitment you know then you know that solves the work ethic check off if you have that commitment then then your passion is probably infectious.

但是，一旦你愿意做出你知道的承诺，你就会知道这解决了职业道德问题，如果你有这种承诺，那么你的激情可能就具有感染力。

\[00:05:31\] It probably means you can in fact find other people and make them as excited about your idea as you do so you can use it so you have to be a good communicator you\'ve got to be able to excite other people or the management part you can use a trick of leading by example.

[00：05：31]这可能意味着你可以找到其他人，让他们对你的想法感到兴奋，因为你可以利用它，这样你就必须成为一个很好的沟通者，你必须能够激发其他人的积极性，或者你可以使用以身作则的技巧。

Yes right.

是的对。

You don\'t have to use leadership techniques you just say I\'m going to go do this and everybody goes as it with you.

你不需要使用领导技巧，你只是说我要这么做，每个人都跟你一样。

Correct.

对，是这样

\[00:05:53\] But but for management and recruiting you do have to educate yourself.

[00：05：53]但是为了管理和招聘，你必须教育自己。

You have to get advice about that.

你得听听这方面的建议。

\[00:06:00\] Now there\'s many many books and blogs about how to do that.

[00：06：00]现在有很多关于如何做到这一点的书籍和博客。

So if you have the desire you can you can DIY you can do it yourself because there is lots of resources out there for you to educate yourself on the skills that you have to acquire that you\'re not born with them.

所以，如果你有这样的愿望，你可以自己动手，因为有很多资源可以让你自己去学习那些你不是与生俱来的技能。

\[00:06:19\] They don\'t have to worry about managing people yet though that\'s like a good problem to have.

[00：06：19]他们还不需要担心管理人员，尽管这是一个很好的问题。

\[00:06:25\] Yeah yeah.

[00：06：25]是的。

Freed\'s you\'ve gotten to a certain point you can afford to hire people that you then have to manage.

自由，你已经到了一定程度，你有能力雇佣你必须管理的人。

Yeah.

嗯

\[00:06:31\] The first thing you gotta do is your idea has to be infectious enough that you have to find a co-founder.

[00：06：31]你要做的第一件事是，你的想法必须具有足够的感染力，以至于你必须找到一个联合创始人。

Since most companies start with with at least two people and they usually start with two people who know each other yeah.

因为大多数公司一开始至少有两个人，所以他们通常从认识对方的两个人开始，是的。

And so they\'re able to feed on each other\'s excitement and then go from there.

这样他们就能以彼此的兴奋为食，然后从那里出发。

\[00:06:51\] So when you\'re when you\'re deciding who to invest in.

[00：06：51]所以当你决定投资谁的时候。

This is not just a way to get Ron\'s money it\'s also heuristic for figuring out what works because how many startups you invest in now since this is my 20th year of angel investing.

这不仅仅是获取罗恩资金的一种方式，它也是一种启发式的方法，可以找出什么是可行的，因为你现在投资了多少初创公司，因为这是我投资天使的第20年。

\[00:07:07\] So anniversary just like it\'s the 10th Startup School and in the 20 years we\'ve invested over 750 companies but in investing in the 750 companies each of which has a founder\'s team we have talked to thousands of companies about potentially investing because for every company we invest in we look at 30.

[00：07：07]周年纪念日就像第10次创业学校一样，在过去的20年里，我们已经投资了750多家公司，但在投资750家公司时，每个公司都有一个创始人团队，我们已经和成千上万家公司讨论了潜在投资的问题，因为我们投资的每一家公司都有30家。

So what.

那又怎样。

Well yeah 21000 company.

嗯，是的，21000公司。

That\'s that\'s why I age ages up to 13 people.

这就是为什么我年龄在13岁以下。

You realize you\'ve looked at 21000 companies.

你知道你已经看过21000家公司了。

Yes.

是

Now I didn\'t look at them all because SCVNGR is 13 people now.

现在我没有全部看，因为SCVNGR现在13岁了。

Funny enough.

够有趣的了。

I don\'t I don\'t do any due diligence anymore.

我不再做任何尽职调查了。

I just help portfolio companies with with hard unique problems with the SVR teams completely build out now and they do all the diligence.

我只是帮助投资组合公司与SVR团队一起解决困难、独特的问题，现在完全建立起来，他们会尽职尽责。

Okay.

好的。

I\'m not a lottery picker.

我不是选彩票的。

How does the Espey team how does the SBA Angel team work.

Espey团队是如何运作的？SBA天使团队是如何工作的？

Well we\'re up we\'re up to 13 people.

我们最多有13个人。

\[00:08:10\] If you look at me you could call me the grandfather because David Lee and Brian Pokornya.k.a.

[00：08：10]如果你看着我，你可以叫我祖父，因为大卫·李(David Lee)和布赖恩·博科尔尼(Brian Pokornya.k.k.)。

coach they\'re becoming the Wise Old Men.

教练，他们正在成为智者老人。

I mean they\'ve been around me now for close to 10 years each.

我的意思是，他们现在已经在我身边近10年了。

And so they they have the pattern recognition.

所以他们有模式识别。

\[00:08:31\] They\'re now solving all the problems I used to solve five years ago so everybody\'s escalating their role.

[00：08：31]他们现在正在解决我五年前曾经解决过的所有问题，所以每个人的角色都在升级。

And then you have Kevin Carter and tofor my son who are also becoming wise old men because they\'ve been around Espey Angel for five years.

还有凯文·卡特和我的儿子，他们也成为了聪明的老人，因为他们已经在EspeyAngel身边五年了。

But but we are Reifel focused on generational planning.

但我们专注于代际规划。

I believe this industry belongs to young people.

我相信这个行业属于年轻人。

And so you know tofor and Kevin are getting close to 30 and we\'ve actually said when you\'re 30 you know you better make sure you have we have four or five people at Esmie Angel in their 20s because the people in their 20s are the good pickers.

所以你知道，托福和凯文都快到30岁了，我们说过，当你30岁的时候，你最好确保我们有四五个20多岁的埃斯米天使的人，因为他们20多岁的人都是不错的挑选者。

And then as you get wiser and older you\'re more better advice givers to the founder.

然后，随着你变得越来越聪明和成熟，你就会给创始人更好的建议。

\[00:09:23\] Interesting interesting.

[00：09：23]有趣，有趣。

So there\'s that\'s interesting that in the adventure business picking and giving advice are different skills that peek at different ages correct in our opinion absolutely.

有趣的是，在冒险活动中，挑选和提供建议是不同的技能，在我们看来，不同的年龄是正确的。

\[00:09:35\] So I\'m an age of bigot and I keep telling our team mate make sure we hire and bring in really smart 20 year olds cause in in 30 years I hope they\'re Roncon way and they\'re being interviewed you know by Sam.

[00：09：35]所以我是个偏执的人，我不停地告诉我们的队友，一定要在30年内雇佣和引进真正聪明的20岁年轻人，我希望他们是朗肯的方式，他们会接受山姆的采访，你知道的。

\[00:09:53\] You need investors you can actually do the hill use instant messaging apps that link make the photo disappear and stuff like that.

\[00：09：53]你需要投资者，你真的可以这么做，使用即时通讯应用程序链接，使照片消失等诸如此类的事情。

\[00:09:59\] Yes.

[00：09：59]是的。

Great.

太棒了

Yeah.

嗯

Kevin Carter on our team.

我们队的凯文·卡特。

Twenty four at the time he picked that company he tapped me on the shoulder.

当他挑选那家公司的时候，他拍了拍我的肩膀。

\[00:10:10\] He goes that\'s important.

[00：10：10]他说那很重要。

Go fly toL.A.

飞到洛杉矶去。

and spend time with him.

花点时间陪他。

\[00:10:15\] Okay and that worked out.

[00：10：15]好的，这就解决了。

That worked out.

结果成功了。

Yeah.

嗯

\[00:10:20\] By the way if you want a list of the companies Ron has invested in it it would be shorter to give a list of the ones he hasn\'t invested in.

[00：10：20]顺便说一句，如果你想要一份罗恩投资过的公司的名单，那么给出他没有投资过的公司的名单就更短了。

\[00:10:27\] Just assume that if you\'ve heard of some big famous startup run as an investor and you\'ll you\'ll pretty much be right.

[00：10：27]假设你听说过一家著名的大型创业公司，作为一名投资者，你很可能是对的。

I just assume it.

我只是假设。

So what about what should people do.

那么人们应该做什么呢。

I was just talking about this what people should do in college if they wanted to start a startup later.

我只是在说，如果人们想以后创业，他们应该在大学里做些什么。

What do you think people should do before starting a startup.

在创业之前，你认为人们应该做些什么？

Do you have opinions about that.

你对此有什么看法吗。

\[00:10:52\] Well I you know whether or not they\'re in college for me really doesn\'t matter because there are founders who didn\'t go to college at all.

[00：10：52]嗯，你知道他们是否为我而上大学并不重要，因为有些创始人根本就没有上过大学。

Are founders who went to some of college and dropped out and then there some that went all the way through college Larry and Serguei went all the way through college and dropped out of the JD program at Stanford.

他们都是创办人，他们上了一些大学，然后退学了，有些人一路走到大学，拉里和塞尔盖一路走到大学，然后退出了斯坦福大学的JD项目。

\[00:11:17\] So I don\'t think it\'s about where you\'re at.

[00：11：17]所以我不认为这是关于你在哪里的问题。

I think it\'s about when when the idea comes in your mind that compelling idea that aha moment that says this is it.

我认为这是关于当这个想法出现在你脑海中的时候，那个令人信服的想法，啊，那一刻，它说的就是它。

\[00:11:31\] This is a company and it\'s usually based around a personal experience where where you have that aha moment and you\'re so motivated by it and taken by it that if you\'re not in school or if you\'re in school it doesn\'t matter you stop what you\'re doing and go pursue that idea.

[00：11：31]这是一家公司，它通常以个人经历为基础，在这种经历中，你拥有这样的时刻，你被它所激励，被它所占据，以至于如果你不在学校，或者你在学校，那么你停止你正在做的事情并去追求这个想法并不重要。

\[00:11:52\] So what you want to do is you want to set yourself up so you have these aha moments these personal experiences correct you and you could almost be anywhere for that to happen.

[00：11：52]所以你想要做的是设置好自己，这样你就有了这些啊哈时刻，这些个人经历对你来说是正确的，你几乎在任何地方都能做到这一点。

\[00:12:02\] I mean for Chad Hurley and Steve Chen they were at a dinner party took a video and found out that there was no easy way to upload that video and just share it with the other guests with Zach.

[00：12：02]我的意思是，对于查德·赫利和史蒂夫·陈来说，他们参加了一个晚宴，拍了一段视频，发现上传这段视频并不容易，只是和扎克分享。

It was like I don\'t want to go through the physical hard copy Facebook at Harvard.

就好像我不想翻阅哈佛大学的硬拷贝Facebook。

Why can\'t that just be on my computer.

为什么不能只在我的电脑上。

And then 10 years later why can\'t that be on my phone.

十年后为什么我的手机上就不能这样。

Yeah.

嗯

So you know Shawn Fanning his roommate wanted to share songs with other people in his dorm.

所以你知道他的室友肖恩·范宁想和宿舍里的其他人分享歌曲。

So Shawn Fanning hacked together a music sharing app.

所以肖恩·范宁黑了一款音乐分享应用。

\[00:12:42\] So it\'s it\'s based around a need and an idea in all that creates the huge companies in all the cases you mentioned the need was the founders own need.

[00：12：42]所以它是建立在一个需求和一个想法的基础上，在所有的情况下创造了大公司，在你提到的所有情况下，需要是创建者自己的需求。

Absolutely.

绝对一点儿没错

\[00:12:54\] All the biggest companies are based on a founder who had a need hacked it together and then said hey wait a minute other people probably want this and then and then they start to grow on their own.

[00：12：54]所有的大公司都是建立在一位创始人的基础上的，他需要把它合并起来，然后说，嘿，等等，其他人可能想要这样，然后他们就开始自己成长了。

\[00:13:10\] Notice what you said.

[00：13：10]注意你说的话。

The realization that other people might want it comes afterwards correct.

意识到别人可能想要它，这是事后正确的。

So it really it\'s not even supposed to be for other people in the beginning.

所以，在开始的时候，它甚至不应该是为其他人准备的。

Yeah yeah a lot of it is serendipity.

是啊，很多都是巧合。

\[00:13:22\] But once once the serendipity phase gets over then you need to start thinking about product market fit you know who is the customer for this.

[00：13：22]但是一旦偶然的阶段过去了，你需要开始考虑产品市场的适合性，你知道谁是这方面的客户。

It\'s all about users which is why why see is so successful is once you come up with the idea then why mantra is well how do you how do you how do you find users who also want this product.

这一切都是关于用户的，这就是为什么See是如此成功的原因是，一旦你想出了这个想法，那么为什么咒语是好的呢？你怎么找到同样想要这个产品的用户呢？

\[00:13:47\] Because unless you create a market there is no need for the product.

[00：13：47]因为除非你创造一个市场，否则就不需要这个产品。

\[00:13:51\] When you look at startups and you\'re thinking of investing in them do you care a lot about the story about how they started working on the idea.

[00：13：51]当你看到初创公司，你在考虑投资它们时，你会非常关心他们是如何开始研究这个想法的。

\[00:13:59\] I absolutely do.

[00：13：59]我绝对相信。

I mean I think the more compelling and personal story is the more excited I get about the company early on even though I don\'t know you know whether or not it\'s going to be a huge huge company.

我的意思是，我认为更有说服力和私人故事是越让我兴奋的公司早期，即使我不知道你知道它是否会是一家大公司。

But what I\'ve said it probably to a lot of people in this room one of the first questions I ask is what inspired you to start the company and it is an inspiration.

但我可能对在座的很多人说了这句话，我首先问的问题之一是，是什么激励了你创办这家公司，这是一种激励。

\[00:14:27\] You know when it goes in your head you are inspired by it and then and then you are driven by it.

[00：14：27]你知道，当它进入你的脑海时，你会受到它的鼓舞，然后你就会被它所驱使。

\[00:14:37\] So do you also care a lot about the story about how the founding team.

[00：14：37]那么，你也很关心创建团队的故事吗？

Do you hear tension to that.

你听到那种紧张的声音了吗。

\[00:14:44\] Yes.

[00：14：44]是。

Very very important to understand how you as I said before most companies have a couple of founders and it\'s very important to know how those two founders met how they interact with each other.

就像我之前说过的，非常重要的是要了解你是如何拥有两位创始人的，而且非常重要的是要知道这两位创始人是如何相遇的，他们是如何相互交流的。

Remember when we first meet them it\'s usually two or three people and I\'m always watching how they interact.

记得当我们第一次见到他们的时候，通常是两三个人，我总是在观察他们是如何互动的。

If one person starts answering the other person\'s question then interrupts them a lot you know ding ding ding.

如果一个人开始回答另一个人的问题，那就打断他们很多，你知道丁仃。

The warning signal those two founders from aren\'t going to get along forever and they\'re probably right now fighting about who\'s going to be the CEO when in the early days it doesn\'t matter who the CEO is it matters if you can find users and you have a compelling product.

这两位创始人发出的警告信号是，他们不会永远相处下去，他们现在可能正在为谁会成为CEO而争吵，而在最初的日子里，谁是CEO并不重要，重要的是你能否找到用户，你是否拥有一款引人注目的产品。

\[00:15:31\] So how can these people be they.

[00：15：31]那么这些人怎么可能是他们呢？

They\'re interested in starting startups.

他们对创业感兴趣。

How how can they find potential co founders when they have someone they\'re thinking of starting a company with.

当他们有一个人想和他们一起创办一家公司的时候，他们怎么能找到潜在的联合创始人呢？

Watch what sort of filter should they.

看看他们应该用什么样的过滤器。

How should they apply.

它们应该如何应用。

How can they tell if this person would make a good co-founder.

他们怎么知道这个人会不会成为一个好的联合创始人。

\[00:15:47\] Well most cofounders you know when I think about this most cofounders are collaborating and end up coming up with the idea together.

[00：15：47]好吧，大多数的联合创始人，当我想到这一点的时候，大多数的联合创始人都是合作的，最后一起想出了这个想法。

\[00:16:01\] If you look at Facebook Pinterest Google there\'s there are two founders for all.

[00：16：01]如果你看看Facebook，Pinterest，Google，有两个创始人。

Two or three there\'s two founders for all these companies and they actually come up with the idea together.

在所有这些公司中，有两三位创始人，他们实际上是一起想出了这个想法。

Yes one of them is the one that says I feel the need.

是的，其中一个是说我觉得需要的人。

But the co-founder ends up being a friend of theirs or a colleague who says Wow I agree with you and I want to work on that.

但这位联合创始人最终成为了他们的朋友或同事，他说：“哇，我同意你的观点，我想在这方面努力。”

Wow.

哇

I think that\'s goofy and I don\'t want any part of it.

我认为那是愚蠢的，我不想参与其中。

But it\'s the co-founder is usually somebody who shares like 99 percent of the excitement and inspiration of the person who came up with the idea.

但共同创办人通常会分享出这个想法的人99%的兴奋和灵感。

\[00:16:42\] So you don\'t.

[00：16：42]所以你不能。

Chad Hurley and Steve Chen.

查德·赫利和史蒂夫·陈。

You don\'t just want to work on interesting problems.

你不只是想研究有趣的问题。

You want to work on interesting problems with other people.

你想和别人一起解决有趣的问题。

\[00:16:51\] Absolutely it\'s a collaborative process.

[00：16：51]绝对是一个协作的过程。

You know how excited are you going to get or accomplish something if it\'s just you.

你知道，如果只有你一个人，你会多么兴奋地得到或完成某件事。

\[00:17:01\] I mean there are single founder companies out there but very few.

[00：17：01]我的意思是，有一些单一的创始人公司，但很少。

\[00:17:06\] Why.

[00：17：06]为什么。

Why do you think there are so few.

你觉得为什么这么少。

Because I can tell you from looking at Y Combinator applications a huge number of single founders applying twice maybe half the applications are single founders.

因为我可以告诉你，从Y Combinator应用程序来看，大量的单身创始人申请了两次，也许一半是单身创始人。

I didn\'t know that.

我不知道。

Yeah well no but like they\'re disproportionately unlikely to get accepted.

是的，不，但是他们不成比例地不太可能被接受。

\[00:17:24\] Yeah.

[00：17：24]是的。

\[00:17:25\] So.

[00：17：25]所以。

There you go.

给你。

There you heard it here.

你在这里听到了。

You heard it here.

你在这里听到了。

\[00:17:31\] If you fly to icy there should be two of you but not if that means like putting something like Craigslist snobbism flying away.

[00：17：31]如果你飞到冰上，应该有你们两个人，但如果这意味着像Craigslist势利主义之类的东西飞走了。

Yeah don\'t do that.

是啊，别那么做。

It obviously can\'t be forced.

显然不能强迫。

\[00:17:44\] So if you get this idea in your head think about Mark Zuckerberg or Ben Silverman you know Ben Silverman\'s idea when he started Pinterest was really obtuse you know where he said I think people should be using the Internet to discover things and people look at them like wow.

[00：17：44]如果你脑子里有这个想法，想想马克·扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)或本·西尔弗曼(Ben Silverman)，你知道本·西尔弗曼(Ben Silverman)在他创立Pinterest的时候的想法非常愚蠢，你知道他说过，我认为人们应该利用互联网来发现事物，人们看上去就像哇。

\[00:18:04\] What\'s that about.

[00：18：04]那是关于什么的？

Well you know I used to collect things when I was a kid.

你知道我小时候经常收集东西。

If you put those collections on the Internet and enough people put on their collections people start discovering things that they\'re interested in sound so lame doesn\'t it.

如果你把这些收藏品放到网上，有足够多的人把它们放在自己的收藏上，人们就会发现他们对声音很感兴趣的东西，是吗？

\[00:18:19\] History has proven that it is not.

[00：18：19]历史证明事实并非如此。

No I know but all the time so the time it took him forever to get funded.

不，我知道，但是一直以来，他花了很长时间才得到资助。

\[00:18:26\] So what did what did Ben Silverman do.

[00：18：26]本·西尔弗曼做了什么？

Everyone he talked to starting with his mother who I think is the biggest spender on earth.

与他交谈的每一个人都是从他母亲开始的，我认为他是世界上花钱最多的人。

He evangelized his product and talked to anyone he could find and said What do you think of this.

他传道他的产品，并与任何他能找到的人交谈，并说，你对此有何看法？

And then you find someone who says Jesus I think that is awesome.

然后你找到一个说耶稣我觉得很棒的人。

That is so interesting.

太有趣了。

Can I work with you on it.

我能和你合作吗。


\[00:18:50\] KABUM you have a co-founder.

[00：18：50]KABUM你有一个联合创始人。

You have somebody as excited as you are about this brand new neophyte idea.

你有一个和你一样兴奋的人对这个全新的新想法感到兴奋。

\[00:18:59\] All right so if you if you have actually built the thing with another person that\'s a good sign that they would make a good co-founder because they have the same credibility as you.

[00：18：59]好吧，如果你真的和另一个人一起建造了这个东西，那是一个很好的迹象，表明他们会成为一个很好的联合创始人，因为他们和你一样有信誉。

So how did people know when their idea that they\'re so excited about is actually bad if what if.

那么，人们怎么知道，当他们如此兴奋的想法实际上是坏的，如果。

How can they tell if a lame sounding idea is actually lame or if it\'s just one of these ideas it sounds lame in the beginning because it\'s such an outlier.

他们怎么能分辨出一个蹩脚的想法到底是站不住脚的，还是仅仅是这些想法中的一个，它在一开始听起来很蹩脚，因为它是如此离奇。

\[00:19:24\] Well yeah I mean you have to be careful about that because a lot of ideas that seem like they are bad end up being huge.

[00：19：24]嗯，是的，我的意思是，你必须小心，因为很多看起来很糟糕的想法最终都是巨大的。

So I think it\'s about persistence and conviction about your idea.

所以我认为这是关于你的想法的坚持和信念。

\[00:19:39\] How can you tell as an investor see these companies as an age where the idea CEOs still seem OK as an investor.

[00：19：39]当一个投资者看到这些公司时，你怎么知道，作为一个投资者，CEO们的想法似乎还不错。

\[00:19:46\] I cannot tell that all ASV Angel invests in is people so we end.

[00：19：46]我不知道ASV天使所有的投资都是人，所以我们就结束了。

So yeah we don\'t even know we cannot predict the success or failure in 40 percent of our investments fail.

所以是的，我们甚至不知道我们无法预测我们40%的投资失败的成败。

We think that failure rates lower than most of the industry but we can\'t tell.

我们认为该行业的失败率低于大多数行业，但我们无法判断。

So we invest in the traits of the individual.

所以我们投资于个人的特质。

\[00:20:12\] OK so let\'s talk about specific individuals.

[00：20：12]好吧，让我们谈谈具体的个人。

BEN SILVERMAN For example what what traits did he have that made you invest OK.

例如，本·西尔弗曼(BenSilverman)有哪些特质让你投资得很好。

\[00:20:22\] For him it was his rifle focus on the product.

[00：20：22]对他来说，这是他对产品的关注。

Now keep in mind Reifel focus on the product also applied to Larry Zuck.

现在请记住，雷菲尔专注于产品也适用于拉里·扎克。

It you know Dropbox RVN be it applies to every successful founder is they were Reifel focused about the product to the point of being rude and a lot of them get accused of being arrogant because they\'re so focused on the product because other people say hey will you come to this event or will you get interviewed by the New York Times and they\'re going like why would I ever want to do that.

你知道，Dropbox RVN-不管它适用于每一个成功的创始人-他们都把注意力集中在了产品上，他们中的很多人被指责傲慢，因为他们太专注于产品，因为其他人说你会来参加这个活动，或者你会接受“纽约时报”的采访，他们会喜欢我为什么要这么做。

\[00:21:01\] When I can make my product better because guess what.

[00：21：01]当我能把我的产品做得更好的时候，你猜怎么着。

I went from 10000 users last month to 25000 users and in the next month I can get it to 50 or 100000 users why would I want anyone to distract me with anything else.

我从上个月的10000用户增加到了25000用户，在下个月我就可以把它增加到50或100000用户，为什么我想让其他人来分散我的注意力呢？

And that focus on the product is what builds huge companies.

对产品的关注是建立大公司的原因。

And you know it\'s so contagious other people want to come join your team and help you.

而且你知道这很有感染力，其他人想加入你的团队帮助你。

But some some of the ones that were counterintuitive would be like an air b be like they want me to share a room in my house.

但是有些违反直觉的人会像空气一样，就像他们想让我在我的房子里共用一个房间。

\[00:21:37\] But the 2008 mortgage crisis in New York helped Air B and B cause in New York in 2008.

[00：21：37]但2008年纽约的抵押贷款危机帮助了2008年B和B航空公司在纽约的事业。

There were thousands of people if they didn\'t rent a room in their house they were going to be foreclosed on.

有成千上万的人，如果他们不租一个房间在他们的房子，他们将被取消赎回权。

And that was that was the mushrooming of Air B and B and then lo and behold they found out that every single person on earth wants to do this.

这就是B空气的雨后春笋，然后他们发现地球上的每一个人都想这样做。

Yeah it\'s sort of this is a worldwide phenomena.

是的，这是一种世界性的现象。

\[00:22:05\] Dropbox would be another example.

[00：22：05]Dropbox是另一个例子。

I already have a storage device.

我已经有存储设备了。

Why.

为什么

Why would I want to move to the cloud.

我为什么要搬到云端去。

What\'s that.

那是什么？

\[00:22:13\] Do you remember when you first met Drew Housden yes.

[00：22：13]你还记得你第一次见到德鲁·豪斯顿的时候吗？是的。

What was it about him that you like.

你喜欢他是怎么回事。

What traits.

什么特质。

\[00:22:19\] Yeah well shame on me I didn\'t invest in Dropbox right away.

[00：22：19]是啊，真可惜，我没有马上投资Dropbox。

\[00:22:23\] So I was you know in that case I saw a great entrepreneur and I sometimes we do get over opinionated about the idea and that is always a mistake when we do drop Oxenham BMB we love the founders cheese that idea.

[00：22：23]所以你知道吗，在那种情况下，我看到了一位伟大的企业家，我有时确实会克服对这个想法的固执己见，而当我们放弃奥克森汉姆BMB的时候，这总是一个错误，我们喜欢创始人的想法。

The idea is not our job in my opinion.

在我看来，这个想法不是我们的工作。

Yeah our job is to invest in great great founders.

是的，我们的工作是投资于伟大的创始人。

\[00:22:50\] I know this sounds like an insulting question but it\'s really interesting you\'ve been doing this for 20 years.

[00：22：50]我知道这听起来像是一个侮辱人的问题，但你这么做已经20年了，这真的很有趣。

Why are you still making this mistake.

你为什么还在犯这个错误。

\[00:22:57\] Laughter No I mean it\'s interesting right.

[00：22：57]笑声不，我是说这很有趣，对吧。

There\'s there must be like this.

肯定有这样的情况。

It\'s really powerful magnet like pulling you off to the side.

它是非常强大的磁铁，就像把你拉到一边一样。

\[00:23:05\] It\'s a very risky business.

[00：23：05]这是一项非常冒险的工作。

And since the beginning you knowS.V.

从一开始你就知道。

Angel kind of invented the portfolio approach to investing.

安吉尔发明了投资组合方法。

I always intuitively thought there\'s no way I\'ll ever make the right decision every time so I\'d rather make the right decision about a certain market place and then go find the 20 best companies and hope that one of those wins.

我总是直觉地认为，我不可能每次都做出正确的决定，所以我宁愿对某个市场做出正确的决定，然后去找20家最好的公司，希望其中一家能赢。

\[00:23:32\] And that strategy ends up you know it\'s a great strategy when you started you had this little niche market place called the Internet Internet software.

[00：23：32]这个策略最终你知道这是一个很好的策略，当你开始的时候，你有了一个叫做互联网软件的利基市场。

\[00:23:42\] Right.

[00：23：42]对。

It was.

确实是。

I\'m not joking.

我不是在开玩笑。

\[00:23:43\] Back in 1994 when I started this was investing in 1994 Mark Andriessen had just graduated from the University of Illinois had not started Netscape but in 1994 I had finished doing three startups and had dabbled in angel investing and said I want to do this the rest of my life.

1994年，当我开始投资的时候，马克·安德里森刚刚从伊利诺伊大学毕业，并没有创办网景公司，但在1994年，我完成了三家初创公司，并涉足天使投资公司，并说我想在我的余生中这样做。

I teamed up with Ben Rosen who was then the chairman of Compaq and we said and we both had plenty of gray hair at the time.

我和当时担任康柏董事长的本·罗森(BenRosen)合作，我们说，当时我们都有很多白发。

We said okay let\'s go angel invest together.

我们说好的，让我们一起去投资天使吧。

OK what are we going to invest in.

好的，我们要投资什么。

Because we were going to invest in everything and we said let\'s invest.

因为我们要投资所有的东西，我们说让我们投资吧。

You said not hardware yet for sure not hard already done that and for sure not packaged software because I had done that.

你说过硬件还不是很难，已经做了，当然也没有打包软件，因为我已经做过了。

\[00:24:33\] And we said let\'s invest in this thing called the Internet because it it\'s at zero and we can watch it grow and therefore it\'ll be interesting and exciting and 20 years later that is all we\'re doing Internet software.

[00：24：33]我们说，让我们投资于这个叫做互联网的东西，因为它是零的，我们可以看到它的成长，因此它将是有趣和令人兴奋的，20年后，这就是我们所做的所有互联网软件。

\[00:24:54\] So I notice the words you\'re using here you haven\'t mentioned anything about money.

[00：24：54]所以我注意到你在这里使用的单词，你没有提到任何关于钱的事情。

\[00:25:00\] I think that that you mean making money or because you\'re investors everybody thinks investors are like in it for the money.

[00：25：00]我认为你是指赚钱，或者因为你是投资者，每个人都认为投资者是为了钱而投资的。

\[00:25:08\] Right.

[00：25：08]对。

\[00:25:09\] Well I my view.

[00：25：09]我的看法。

\[00:25:11\] I\'m in it because I love meeting great founders helping them and watching them be successful.

[00：25：11]我之所以参与其中，是因为我喜欢见到伟大的创始人，帮助他们，看着他们成功。

I get to meet people.

我要去见人。

I get to meet these founders before they\'re famous.

我要在这些创始人成名之前认识他们。

And there is nothing more satisfying than giving advice to Mark Zuckerberg to Ben Silverman or Larry Page in the first two years of their existence and then watching them fly watching this rocket just like sitting watch the rocket ship take off and say wow I was part of that.

没有什么比马克·扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)在他们出生的头两年里给本·西尔弗曼(Ben Silverman)或拉里·佩奇(Larry Page)提供建议更让人满意的了，然后看着他们飞起来，看着这枚火箭，就像坐在那里看着火箭飞船起飞，然后说哇

\[00:25:47\] I I I I put the first gas in the gas tank of that company.

[00：25：47]我在那家公司的储气罐里放了第一批汽油。

So I think money fame fortune notoriety.

所以我觉得金钱、名利、财富都是声名狼藉。

\[00:25:59\] That\'s all byproducts of of working your ass off.

[00：25：59]那都是你拼命工作的副产品。

\[00:26:04\] You know I noticed a similarity between the way you operate and what you look for in founders.

[00：26：04]你知道，我注意到了你的经营方式和你在创始人身上寻找的东西之间的相似之处。

Right.

右（边），正确的

The founders aren\'t in it for the money either.

创始人也不是为了钱。

They\'re just trying to make this amazing product and the company\'s success as a byproduct.

他们只是想使这个惊人的产品和公司的成功作为副产品。

Right.

右（边），正确的

You just Lig are super into these founders and ASV angel investing and all these companies with the biproduct.

你只是利格是超级进入这些创始人和ASV天使投资和所有这些公司与双产品。

\[00:26:22\] And that\'s that\'s why we all like each other.

[00：26：22]这就是我们都喜欢对方的原因。

Yeah.

嗯

It\'s so even though when they get an e-mail say much of them.

即使当他们收到一封电子邮件时，也会对他们说很多话。

\[00:26:28\] But but we have we are kindred spirits does it help you think as an investor to have been a founder yourself.

[00：26：28]但是，我们有着相似的精神，作为一个投资者，你认为自己是一个创立者，这对你有帮助吗？

\[00:26:38\] For sure for sure because because I know how hard it is.

肯定是因为我知道这有多难。


\[00:26:44\] So if I hadn\'t founded a company myself I wouldn\'t feel like I had as much credibility.

如果不是我自己创立了一家公司，我就不会觉得自己有那么多的可信度了。

\[00:26:51\] Well I\'m more does it help you pick people because you were literally looking for kindred spirit.

[00：26：51]我更能帮你挑选人，因为你真的是在寻找同类的灵魂。

\[00:26:56\] Yes yes it does yes it does because because you can say hey will this person work 24/7.

[00：26：56]是的，因为你可以说，这个人会全天候工作吗？

Is this person a good communicator or will they follow through so here\'s a question.

这个人是一个很好的沟通者，还是他们会坚持到底？这里有个问题。

\[00:27:10\] If someone if a founder was going to fool other investors but not fool you because you had been a founder yourself and you could recognize kindred spirits.

[00：27：10]如果一个人，如果一个创始人要愚弄其他投资者，而不是愚弄你，因为你自己也是一个创立者，你就能认出那些志同道合的人。

What would this founder be like.

这位创始人会是什么样子。

What are the kinds of founders that would fool other investors but not fool you.

什么样的创始人会愚弄其他投资者，却不会愚弄你。

What do you not fall for.

你为什么不喜欢。

\[00:27:30\] Well I\'m going to go back to the to the to the focus on the product.

[00：27：30]好吧，我要回到对产品的关注上。

I see.

我明白了。

\[00:27:35\] And so if they don\'t care a little too much about the product correct then that that\'s a warning sign that that trait 10 year ok I\'ve been doing this for 20 years.

[00：27：35]如果他们不太在意产品的正确性，那就是一个警告信号，这个特征10年了，好吧，我已经这么做了20年了。

\[00:27:48\] That trait didn\'t start pinging in my brain until like 10 years ago.

[00：27：48]这种特质直到10年前才开始在我的大脑中跳动。

And then five years ago it became an alarm be it could be because a lot of it probably Ben Silverman a similar one was probably the tipping point where that\'s all he cared about.

五年前，它变成了一个警钟，可能是因为很多事情，可能是本·西尔弗曼(BenSilverman)-一个类似的人-可能是他唯一关心的临界点。

And then from pattern recognition I said wow that\'s all Larry cared about.

然后从模式识别我说，哇，这就是拉里所关心的。

That\'s all Jack Dorsey cared about.

这就是杰克？多尔西所关心的。

The and that\'s all Steve Jobs care and that\'s all.

这都是史蒂夫·乔布斯所关心的，仅此而已。

\[00:28:22\] Yeah that\'s that\'s all these great people care about.

[00：28：22]是的，这就是所有这些伟大的人所关心的。

It\'s focus focus on the product.

重点放在产品上。

There\'s a guy at Pinterest Tim Kendall.

有个家伙在Pinterest Tim Kendall。

I hope he has a hundred of these shirts because he wears the same shirt every single day of the year.

我希望他有一百件这样的衬衫，因为他一年中的每一天都穿同样的衬衫。

\[00:28:35\] He\'s the head of product there and it\'s a circle with the word focus and even when they have outside visitors who are like super important he will walk into the room with his focus T-shirt.

[00：28：35]他是那里产品的领头羊，这是一个圆圈，上面写着“焦点”这个词，即使他们有外部访客，他们都是超级重要的，他也会带着他的焦点T恤走进房间。

And he\'s not taking it off.

他不会把它取下来的。

\[00:28:53\] But boy does that count.

[00：28：53]但那小子算不算。

\[00:28:59\] OK.

[00：28：59]好的。

So you might think like you\'re trying to start a startup he\'s trying to start a business you should be business like.

所以你可能会认为你在尝试创业，他想创业，你应该像他一样创业。

Right.

右（边），正确的

And the lesson here is really you should focus almost too much on the actual product.

这里的教训是，你真的应该把太多的精力放在实际的产品上。

\[00:29:11\] Yeah because if you focus on the product obviously the only way to measure success of the product is users and you will keep tweaking that product until user growth starts to explode and then you jump for joy and go for billions of them.

[00：29：11]是的，因为如果你把注意力集中在产品上，那么衡量产品成功的唯一方法就是用户，你会不断调整该产品，直到用户的增长开始膨胀，然后你就会高兴地跳起来，争取数十亿的用户。

\[00:29:32\] So you focus on the product and the business follows correct.

[00：29：32]所以你把注意力集中在产品上，企业就会遵循正确的原则。

Okay.

好的。

\[00:29:39\] So what do young founders specifically get get wrong when they start companies if you if you see a young founder and you think oh my god that\'s such a newb mistake.

[00：29：39]如果你看到一位年轻的创始人，而你认为哦，我的天哪，这是一个新的错误，那么当年轻的创始人创办公司的时候，他们有什么特别的错误呢？

\[00:29:51\] These guys are you know these guys look promising but they\'re so young they\'re doing X right.

[00：29：51]这些家伙，你知道这些家伙看起来很有前途，但是他们太年轻了，他们做得很好。

\[00:29:55\] What do young founders do wrong.

[00：29：55]年轻的创始人做错了什么。

\[00:30:00\] I think it would be lying to yourself after you know you\'ve prototyped the products in the marketplace.

[00：30]我认为当你知道你在市场上制作了产品的原型之后，你就会自欺欺人。

\[00:30:12\] It\'s not getting traction it\'s not admitting that guess what it\'s not working.

[00：30：12]它没有得到牵引，它不承认你猜什么不起作用。

And it\'s great if the founder says Hey stop stop.

如果创始人说“停下来”，那就太好了。

Stop the train.

把火车停下来。

This this idea is not working.

这个想法行不通。

What we need to do to make this idea work because success is binary.

我们需要做些什么才能让这个想法奏效，因为成功是二元的。

You are either successful or you\'re not.

你要么成功要么不成功。

Your product is getting traction or it\'s not.

你的产品是否受到了牵引力？

It\'s not getting traction.

没有牵引力。

The sooner you admit that and start doing things about it the better off everybody\'s going to be.

你越早承认这一点，并开始做这件事，每个人都会更好。

\[00:30:47\] So they\'re too prone to remain in denial.

[00：30：47]所以他们太容易拒绝。

Correct.

对，是这样

And when they get older they\'ve learned to realize this warning signs of denial.

当他们长大后，他们学会了意识到这种否认的警告信号。

\[00:30:58\] It\'s true in many domains actually.

[00：30：58]它实际上在许多领域都是正确的。

So just just being honest with yourself.

所以对自己诚实一点。

\[00:31:04\] What\'s funny is your team will recognize it and admit it before you.

[00：31：04]有趣的是，你的团队会认识到它，并在你面前承认它。

But of course they would never discuss it with you.

但他们当然不会和你讨论这件事。

So when you say hey guess what you call everybody in and have a come to Jesus meeting and say this is not working.

所以，当你说嗨，猜猜你叫每个人进来，并有一个耶稣会议，说这是行不通的。

Everyone in the room in their heads is going oh my god.

房间里的每个人脑子里都在想我的天啊。

\[00:31:24\] The founder knows this is awesome.

[00：31：24]创始人知道这很棒。

\[00:31:28\] This is awesome.

[00：31：28]这太棒了。

Now we\'re a team.

现在我们是一个团队。

Now we can go do something about it.

现在我们可以做点什么了。

And the founder thinks morale is going to go down as a result of this meeting when in fact morale explodes because the team says Jeezy\'s were in trouble.

这位创始人认为，由于这次会议的结果，士气会下降，而事实上，士气会暴涨，因为团队表示，天哪遇到了麻烦。

\[00:31:47\] But we all know we\'re in trouble and we\'re all going to figure it out together.

[00：31：47]但我们都知道我们有麻烦了，我们都会一起解决的。

Not the founder by themselves trying to figure it out.

不是创办人自己想弄明白的。

\[00:31:55\] You know what that reminds me reminds me of what happens when you fire somebody you remain in denial about it for a long time.

[00：31：55]你知道这会让我想起当你解雇某人时会发生什么事，你很长一段时间都在否认这件事。

Yes.

是

And you finally do it and you fire them and you think morale is going to go down and actually everybody is delighted because they know this morale goes up.

最后，你解雇了他们，你认为士气会下降，实际上每个人都很高兴，因为他们知道士气会上升。

\[00:32:10\] I would say firings and layoffs you know if if you\'re running low on money you have to face the fact and you have to lay people off.

[00：32：10]我会说解雇和裁员，你知道的，如果你的钱少了，你必须面对事实，你必须裁员。

Well when you lay people off that is not a good thing for the people getting laid off.

嗯，当你裁员的时候，这对被解雇的人来说不是件好事。

But for the people who are remaining in your company they are saying wow my founder is here to survive.

但对于那些留在你公司的人来说，他们是在说哇，我的创始人是来生存的。

And so we\'re not just going to spend the money to go out of business.

所以我们不打算把钱花在破产上。

And when you lay people off you tend to lay off the deadwood you know and when Deadwood leaves a company morale explodes because the remaining people say wow we\'re not wasting money on them anymore.

而当你裁员的时候，你就会把枯木裁掉，当死木离开公司的时候，士气就会猛增，因为剩下的人会说，哇，我们不会再在他们身上浪费钱了。

I can work harder and take all those people\'s place.

我可以更努力地工作，取代那些人的位置。

\[00:33:00\] I just want to pause for a moment.

[00：33：00]我只想停一会儿。

Is there anybody back there this clock here says 25.

后面有人吗这个钟上写着二十五号。

Does that mean we are already.

这是否意味着我们已经。

\[00:33:07\] Hello Jessica.

[00：33：07]你好，杰西卡。

Are we over.

我们结束了吗。

Is that what that 25 means.

那25是这个意思吗。

\[00:33:16\] Okay uprighted someone should be waving frantically.

[00：33：16]好吧，站起来的人应该疯狂地挥手。

We just got so excited talking about this stuff.

我们只是很兴奋地谈论这件事。

All right.

好的

There\'s a lot to talk about.

有很多话要说。

Is there anything else we should talk about because we\'re already over.

我们还有什么要谈的吗？因为我们已经结束了。

\[00:33:32\] Hopefully you have gotten something out of this.

[00：33：32]希望你从这件事中得到了些什么。

I\'ll be talking to Rob.


我要和罗伯谈谈。
