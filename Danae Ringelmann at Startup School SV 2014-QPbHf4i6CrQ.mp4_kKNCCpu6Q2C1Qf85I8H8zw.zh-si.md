**Danae Ringelmann at Startup School SV 2014-QPbHf4i6CrQ.mp4**

\[00:00:02\] First of all this is totally awesome.

[00：00：02]首先，这真是太棒了。

\[00:00:06\] I want everybody to actually take a minute a moment of silence and appreciate the fact that you\'re here and appreciate the fact that your whole life has been leading to this point you might all be thinking that I\'m about to embark on this journey of startup ville and entrepreneurship but there\'s a reason you\'re sitting in this room and your story has already started.

[00：00：06]我希望每个人都能安静一分钟，欣赏你在这里，欣赏你的一生都在这一点，你们可能都在想，我即将踏上创业和创业之旅，但你坐在这间屋子里，你的故事已经开始了。

So \[00:00:32\] I want to share my story with you and what I hope you realize is that there\'s bigger meaning behind you just wanting to learn a couple tips and tricks of how to be a great entrepreneur.

所以[00：00：32]我想和你分享我的故事，我希望你意识到，你背后有更大的意义，你只是想学习一些关于如何成为一名伟大的企业家的技巧和技巧。

There\'s a bigger mission behind all of that in you and I hope you all take a moment after today to think through that and appreciate that it\'s already there.

在所有这些的背后还有一个更大的任务，我希望你们在今天之后花点时间仔细想想，并欣赏它已经存在了。

So I\'m going to talk today about building what matters.

所以我今天要谈一谈什么是重要的。

I\'m one of the founders of any gogo.

我是任何Gogo的创始人之一。

My journey started pretty much when I was a kid and I\'ll talk about that in a second.

我的旅程是在我还是个孩子的时候开始的，我马上就会谈到这个问题。

But we launching we Gogo back in January 2008.

但我们在2008年1月推出了Gogo。

My two cofounders and I and today we\'re now the largest global online funding platform in the world helping entrepreneurs artists causes activists.

我和我的两位共同创始人和今天的我们现在是世界上最大的全球在线融资平台，帮助企业家、艺术家、事业积极分子。

You name it you want to raise money for it.

你说它的名字，你想为它筹集资金。

People are using it.

人们正在使用它。

Every country every industry to go after their dreams to make it happen.

每个国家，每一个行业都要追求自己的梦想来实现它。

But like I said my story didn\'t start in January 2008 when I decided to start a company.

但就像我说的，我的故事不是从2008年1月开始的，当时我决定创办一家公司。

\[00:01:28\] My story started actually when I was a kid which is why I want you guys all to reflect on your own stories and where you\'ve come from and why you\'re sitting here today.

[00：01：28]我的故事实际上是从我小时候开始的，这就是为什么我想让你们所有人反思你们自己的故事，你们从哪里来，为什么你们今天坐在这里。

I was such daughter of two small business owners in San Francisco.

我是旧金山两个小企业主的女儿。

They were running a brick and mortar business and for 30 years they struggled because they could never get outside loan they could never get access to capital.

他们经营着一家实体企业，30年来他们一直在挣扎，因为他们永远得不到外部贷款，他们永远无法获得资本。

No one would actually give me a loan from a bank or whatever to help grow their business.

实际上，没有人会向我提供银行贷款或其他任何东西来帮助发展他们的业务。

\[00:01:55\] And so they technically bootstrapped for 30 years which sounds like hell in the venture capital world but that\'s what they did.

[00：01：55]所以从技术上讲，他们干了30年，这在风险投资领域听起来像是地狱，但这就是他们所做的。

And their story is like every other small business owner out there trying to make it happen every day.

他们的故事就像所有其他的小企业主一样，每天都在努力实现这一目标。

\[00:02:07\] But in watching them persevere and figure it out and you know cut their salaries when when the economy crashed and September 11th happened all that kind of stuff.

[00：02：07]但是在看着他们坚持不懈地想出办法的时候，你知道，在经济崩溃和911事件发生的时候，他们会减薪。

Watching all that actually grew very aware of a very big problem and that problem with access to capital.

看着所有这些都意识到了一个非常大的问题，以及获得资金的问题。

Why was it so hard to find money and raise money.

为什么这么难找到钱和筹集资金。

Go do what you want to go do in the world that actually led that awareness led me to Wall Street.

去做你想去做的事吧，在这个世界上，实际上是引导着我的意识，把我带到了华尔街。

I\'ve got my first job in New York City.

我在纽约市找到了第一份工作。

Super excited.

超级兴奋。

In corporate finance investment banking how many people in that life.

在公司金融，投资银行，有多少人在那一生。

\[00:02:41\] Yeah.

[00：02：41]是的。

Raise your hand proud.

举起你的手骄傲。

\[00:02:44\] Yeah I\'ve been there.

[00：02：44]是的，我去过那里。

Great training ground but it was one of those weeks where I was working 100 hours a week and I got invited to this event called where Hollywood meets Wall Street.

很棒的训练场，但那是我每周工作100个小时的那一周，我被邀请参加这一名为“好莱坞与华尔街相遇的地方”的活动。

\[00:02:54\] And I was working in the entertainment group so because the word Wall Street was in the title I thought I could justify it to my boss to go.

[00：02：54]我在娱乐集团工作，所以因为华尔街这个词在标题里，我想我可以向我的老板证明我有理由去。

But really I was just an excuse to get out of the office.

但实际上我只是一个离开办公室的借口。

And at this event where Hollywood meets Wall Street was happening.

在这场好莱坞与华尔街交锋的活动上。

I was like what I was expecting to happen was meeting a sea of Hollywood producers talking to these Wall Street bankers and I\'d be this fly on the wall listening to what they\'re actually saying and actually learning what how this business works.

我就像我所期待的那样，遇见了一大群好莱坞制片人，和这些华尔街银行家交谈，我会像一只苍蝇一样，听着他们在说什么，并真正了解到这个业务是如何运作的。

But the exact opposite happened when I got there was about a room this big fall like it is today and I literally was the most popular girl at the party.

但正好相反，当我到达的时候，有一个房间，像今天这样的大瀑布，我是聚会上最受欢迎的女孩。

Why.

为什么

It was a sea of emerging artists all hoping to meet their next angel.

这是一片新兴艺术家的海洋，他们都希望见到自己的下一位天使。

\[00:03:35\] I was the one naive person from a bank that decided to show up and I was 22.

[00：03：35]我是一个天真的人，来自一家银行，当时我22岁。

\[00:03:43\] But what hit me though was I was little kind of overwhelmed by what hit me it was two days later when one of the filmmakers that had met that that night went through the effort and actually paid fifteen dollars to FedEx me his script and in his script he said it was wonderful to me today.

[00：03：43]但令我震惊的是，我对我的打击有点不知所措。两天后，一位电影制片人在那天晚上见过我，花了15美元给联邦快递他的剧本，他在剧本中说今天对我来说太棒了。

I look forward to financing my next film and that\'s when my heart sank because here I was a newbie investment banking analyst.

我期待着为我的下一部电影融资，就在那时，我心灰意冷，因为我是一名新手投资银行分析师。

I didn\'t control any money.

我没有控制任何钱。

I ran spreadsheets I put pitch decks together.

我运行电子表格，我把沥青甲板放在一起。

That\'s what I did.

我就是这么做的。

But here is a man with a lifetime of experience begging me someone was pretty much no experience for money simply because I worked at a bank and that\'s when everything kind of came crashing down.

但是，这是一个有着毕生经验的男人，乞求我，一个人几乎没有赚钱的经验，仅仅是因为我在一家银行工作，而那时一切都崩溃了。

My idealism came crashing down in that moment and I did what any young girl does when you\'re really pissed off and distraught about something you call your mom and I did it for the next 30 minutes I cried on the phone and talked about how unfair this world was how America is not the land of all possibility.

我的理想主义在那一刻崩溃了，我做了任何年轻女孩所做的事情，当你真的很生气和心烦意乱的事情，你称为你的妈妈和我做了30分钟，我在电话中哭了，并谈到了这个世界是多么不公平，因为美国是多么不可能的国家。

\[00:04:45\] It\'s only the land of possibility for the lucky few that are connected and my mom who\'s very busy running her business quietly and patiently waited.

[00：04：45]这只是少数幸运儿的可能之地，而我妈妈正忙着静静地耐心地等待着她的生意。

And when I finally exhausted myself she\'d she inserted and said well that pissed off about it.

当我终于精疲力竭时，她插了口气，说：“我很生气。”

\[00:05:00\] Just go do something about it.

[00：05：00]去做点什么吧。

She hung up on me.

我还没说完呢，她就把电话挂上了

\[00:05:05\] So I did.

[00：05：05]所以我就这么做了。

I started working with some of those filmmakers and theater producers on the site trying to help them raise money and then I started to fail and fail miserably and the biggest failure of all was when I helped a theater producer that I had met that night try to raise money for a play an Arthur Miller play called incident of Vichy which was a play about racial profiling.

我开始在网站上与一些电影制片人和戏剧制片人合作，试图帮助他们筹集资金，然后我开始失败和失败，其中最大的失败是我帮助了一位剧院制片人，那天晚上我遇到了一位制片人，试图为一部名为“维希事件”的话剧筹集资金，这是一部关于种族貌相的戏剧。

Now this is right after September 11th in New York City.

现在就在纽约911事件之后。

So I thought this is it.

所以我以为就这样了。

This is the topic.

这就是主题。

And so for months I worked with him we we rented out a venue about the size of this pacta with an audience like this.

所以我和他一起工作了几个月，我们租出了一个和这样的观众一样大小的场地。

Got actors to volunteer their time even Richard Dreyfus signed up.

甚至理查德·德雷弗斯都报名了。

\[00:05:41\] I hustled to get investors there and the whole point of the night was to do a concert reading a one time showing of this play with a goal that those investors are so impressed by the whole night that they\'ll whip out their checkbooks and cut a check and fund the full production of the play and odd I\'d be on to a new career as a as an Off Broadway theater producer everything went perfect except that last little bit which was the investors turned to me and they said oh my god that was an amazing play.

[00：05：41]我催促投资者到那里去，整晚的目的是做一场音乐会，看一遍这出戏，目标是那些投资者对整个晚上都印象深刻，他们会掏出支票，削减一张支票，为该剧的全部制作提供资金。奇怪的是，我会继续作为一名新的职业作为一名演员。作为一个非百老汇剧院的制片人，一切都很完美，除了最后一点投资者转向我，他们说，哦，天哪，这是一出很棒的戏。

\[00:06:08\] The audience was uproar it was awesome and they turned and they said that was amazing.

[00：06：08]观众们骚动起来，这太棒了，他们转过身来，说这太棒了。

We\'re not investing.

我们不投资。

\[00:06:14\] Good luck.

[00：06：14]祝你好运。

All of it for nothing.

一切都白费了。

I was lost my job because Arthur Miller was faxing me at work.

我丢了工作是因为亚瑟·米勒在工作时给我发传真。

All of it for nothing.

一切都白费了。

\[00:06:22\] And it was actually in that moment that I realized that the reason they didn\'t want to take a risk on me as I was a nobody I didn\'t have a track record on Broadway.

[00：06：22]事实上，就在那一刻，我意识到他们不想冒险的原因，因为我是个无名小卒，我在百老汇没有唱片记录。

\[00:06:32\] And it was in that moment though that I realized that if my parents and this elderly filmmaker who had had a lifetime of experience taught me that finance was broken it was this experience that showed me how it was broken and how it was broken.

[00：06：32]就在那一刻，我意识到，如果我的父母和这位有一辈子经验的老电影制片人告诉我，金融已经崩溃了，正是这种经历告诉了我，它是如何被打破的。

\[00:06:46\] Was that the people who wanted this play to come to life the most which in this case were the actors and the audience.

[00：06：46]这出戏最受欢迎的人是演员和观众。

They together did not have the power or mechanism to make it happen.

他们在一起没有权力或机制来实现这一目标。

And they were completely dependent on these third party gatekeepers or decision makers or investors.

他们完全依赖于这些第三方守门人或决策者或投资者。

\[00:07:04\] To define their destiny and their reality so that pissed me off and that\'s what sent me back to business school.

[00：07：04]定义他们的命运和现实，让我生气，这就是我回到商学院的原因。

I quit finance came up with an idea on how to democratize access to capital.

我退出了金融界，想出了一个如何使资本获得民主化的想法。

I went back to Berkeley to start this business.

我回到伯克利创业。

And it\'s there that I met my cofounders and we launched it and today Indiegogo is now the largest online funding platform in the world.

就在那里，我遇见了我的联合创始人，我们推出了它。今天，Indiegogo已经成为世界上最大的在线融资平台。

We started before the word crowdfunding even existed.

我们在众筹这个词还没有出现之前就开始了。

\[00:07:28\] And so it all sounds nice and perfect but it\'s eight years later and I\'ve learned a ton.

[00：07：28]所以这一切听起来都很好，很完美，但是八年后，我学到了很多东西。

Along the way I failed a ton along the way and what I want to do is kind of share some of the lessons learned because you guys are about to embark on this part of your journey your journey has already began.

一路走来，我失败了一吨，我想要做的是分享一些经验教训，因为你们即将开始这一阶段的旅程已经开始。

But now it\'s time to execute.

但现在是执行的时候了。

And if I can it\'s still just a couple nuggets of insight set you guys up for success.

如果我可以的话\还只是几个关键的洞察力让你们成功了。

I want to do that.

我想这么做。

\[00:07:55\] So the first is no you\'re Y.

[00：07：55]第一个是不，你是Y。

And what I mean by this is why are you starting this company.

我的意思是你为什么要创办这家公司。

\[00:08:03\] What problem are you trying to solve.

[00：08：03]你想解决什么问题。

And why do you care so much.

你为什么这么在乎。

If it\'s not if your reason for being is not authentic to your core chances of you were of you failing we\'ll actually go way up.

如果不是，如果你的理由不真实，你的核心机会，你是你失败，我们会走得更远。

\[00:08:16\] And the reason why is for me my why was I wanted to democratize access to capital.

[00：08：16]对我来说，我的原因是我想要使获得资本的机会民主化。

I was aware of this problem affected my parents.

我意识到这个问题影响了我的父母。

It was now affecting me because I can help the people I wanted to help.

现在它影响了我，因为我可以帮助我想要帮助的人。

And so my wife became I want to democratize access to capital.

于是我的妻子成为了我想要让资本民主化的人。

And the reason it was so important and the reason why it was so helpful is actually my wife found me my cofounders.

它如此重要的原因和它如此有用的原因实际上是我妻子给我找到了我的联合创始人。

It\'s a hard that\'s a hard journey to figure out who should you partner with.

找出你应该和谁合作是一段艰难的旅程。

But when you\'re clear why you\'re doing this and you spew it to the world the people who care about that to join you and because I was viewing it over and over again.

但是当你弄清楚你为什么要这么做，你把它告诉世界，关心它的人们加入你的行列，因为我一遍又一遍地看它。

I was actually able to find my co founders in business school.

实际上，我在商学院找到了我的联合创始人。

The second thing is that your wife gets you out of your way to my original idea was a complete offline fund with a Democratic twist.

第二件事是，你的妻子让你摆脱了我最初的想法，那就是一个完整的离线基金，带有一个民主党的转折。

Not at all what Indiegogo is today.

一点也不像今天的Indiegogo。

And when I met my co founders and they were asking me what my real goals are here and that was to democratize access to capital.

当我遇到我的联合创始人时，他们问我，我的真正目标是什么，那就是让获得资本的渠道民主化。

\[00:09:09\] Slava my co-founder is turning me said well if you really want to do that why aren\'t you using the Internet.

[00：09：09]斯拉夫，我的联合创始人正在把我变成吸血鬼，他说，如果你真的想这么做的话，那你为什么不上网呢？

\[00:09:14\] And I said that is the amazing point.

[00：09：14]我说这是一个令人惊奇的观点。

It is the most democratic tool out there.

这是目前最民主的工具。

You can\'t invest online but that actually led us to coming up with a perks space model innovating pivoting and because of that we\'re able to launch into Gogo and I say that because if if I was more obsessed with the solution of my original idea of what of the product in the solve that I had in mind I would have been stuck on that but because I was more obsessed with my wife and actually solving a bigger problem I didn\'t care how I solved it.

你不能在网上投资，但这实际上导致我们想出了一个额外的空间模型，创新的方向，正因为如此，我们才能发射到Gogo，而我说这是因为如果我更痴迷于解决问题的最初想法-我想要解决的是什么-我会被困在这个问题上，但因为我更痴迷于我的妻子，实际上解决了一个更大的问题，我不在乎我是如何解决这个问题的。

I just wanted to solve it.

我只是想解决这个问题。

And that allowed me to see a better way to solve it.

这让我找到了更好的解决方法。

Another reason to focus on your why is it it gets you through those dark periods which there will be dark periods.

关注你的另一个原因是，它会让你度过那些黑暗的时期。

I like to show this graph because on top was our plan we launched January 2008 raise our first venture around fall of 2008 and then be off to the races.

我喜欢展示这个图表，因为最重要的是，我们在2008年1月启动了我们的计划，在2008年秋季左右启动了我们的第一次冒险活动，然后开始了比赛。

We all know what happened in the fall of 2008.

我们都知道2008年秋天发生了什么。

Things did not go according to plan.

事情没有按计划进行。

Fast forward three and a half years we finally raised that first round of capital.

三年半之后，我们终于筹集了第一轮资金。

So that was three years longer than we actually anticipated.

这比我们预期的要长三年。

I had planned to not take a salary for one year.

我原计划一年内不领薪水的。

I ended up having to survive for four.

最后我只能活到四岁。

\[00:10:19\] It\'s just the reality.

[00：10：19]这只是现实。

But if you\'re.

但如果你是。

Why is not totally you.

为什么不完全是你。

If it\'s not totally powerful and meaningful to you you won\'t stick out that you won\'t stick it out.

如果它对你来说不是完全强大和有意义的，你就不会坚持下去。

Entrepreneurship is just too hard.

创业太难了。

\[00:10:36\] Our first employee Erika turned to us when we hired her in 2011 after we raised our round of capital first round.

[00：10：36]我们的第一批雇员Erika在我们第一轮融资后，于2011年雇佣了她。

She kind of looked at our numbers and shot.

她看着我们的数字就开枪了。

\[00:10:44\] She saw that we were always growing but we not we didn\'t really have that hockey stick growth until the prior couple months right before we raised our round and she looked at her number she said Wow you guys really did stick it out.

[00：10：44]她看到我们一直在成长，但我们没有

\[00:10:55\] Why.

[00：10：55]为什么。

And my co-founder Eric said Well we were passionate about what we were doing despite reason.

我的联合创始人埃里克说，我们对自己所做的事情充满了热情，尽管有理由。

\[00:11:01\] And that sums it up you have to be passion about what you\'re doing despite reason you\'re why also informs your whole strategy.

[00：11：01]概括起来，你必须对自己所做的事情充满激情，尽管你也是为什么要告诉你的整个策略。

\[00:11:10\] So it\'s actually a very practical thing it gives you bump Galanes for how you\'re going to execute.

[00：11：10]这实际上是一件非常实际的事情，它给你提供了如何执行的加兰尼号。

We\'re an open platform because we want to empower the world and allow everybody to matter to them to actually empower the world.

我们是一个开放的平台，因为我们想要增强世界的力量，让每个人对他们来说都很重要，从而真正赋予世界权力。

We can\'t be a gatekeeper ourselves.

我们自己不能做守门人。

We can\'t have an application system.

我们不能有一个应用系统。

So that\'s why we\'ve been an open system since the very beginning and that\'s continuing to be the reason why people use this everyday.

这就是为什么我们从一开始就是一个开放的系统，这也是人们每天使用这个系统的原因。

It also made us be global from the get go which is another reason people use us everyday if we want to truly empower the world we have to be everywhere in the world and that force us to do the hard work to to create the backend infrastructures that we could serve every customer in every country across the world.

它也让我们从一开始就全球化，这也是人们每天使用我们的另一个原因-如果我们想真正赋予世界权力-我们必须在世界的任何地方-这迫使我们努力创造后端基础设施，我们可以为世界上每个国家的每一个客户服务。

It also informs your strategy so we realize that we\'re doing something completely new.

它也告诉了你的策略，所以我们意识到我们正在做一些全新的事情。

We are reinventing a whole new industry called funding and a new way to actually raise money.

我们正在重新创造一个全新的行业，称为资金和一种新的方式来筹集资金。

And so because of that this was a new experience for most people in the world that that allowed us to focus on actual customer happiness being a key driver of our business.

正因为如此，对于世界上大多数人来说，这是一种新的体验，让我们能够专注于真正的客户幸福，这是我们业务的关键驱动力。

And now a key differentiator people uses every day because we help you the most because oftentimes when people raise money this way it\'s the first time they\'ve ever done it.

现在，人们每天都在使用一个关键的区别，因为我们对你的帮助最大，因为当人们以这种方式筹集资金时，这是他们第一次这样做。

And the why also continues to inform your strategy and how you actually build your product.

为什么还要继续告诉你的策略和你如何实际构建你的产品。

So again we want to empower everybody to find what matters to them and everybody to raise money.

因此，我们再次希望赋予每个人权力，让他们找到对他们重要的东西，并让每个人都筹集资金。

That\'s what democratizer ization of capital means to us.

这就是资本民主化对我们的意义。

And so with that you need to have all kinds of funding options.

因此，你需要有各种各样的资金选择。

You can\'t just do it one way or the other and say it\'s our way or the highway you have to give people options so they can maximize their experience and optimize it for their specific needs.

你不能这样或那样做，说这是我们的方式或高速公路，你必须给人们选择，这样他们就可以最大化他们的经验，并优化它，以满足他们的具体需要。

So we have fixed finding flex funding forever funding all kinds of different kinds of funding structures so that people can be successful and one day we\'re actually part of the jobs act happening.

所以我们有固定的FLEX资金，永远为各种不同的资金结构提供资金，这样人们才能成功，有一天我们实际上是就业法案的一部分。

One day we\'ll be able to offer equity crowdfunding when the laws change which we actually helped change as well.

总有一天，当法律改变的时候，我们就可以提供股权众筹资金，而我们实际上也帮助了这些法律的改变。

And the coolest thing about having a really good why though is it attracts amazing people.

拥有一个非常好的东西最酷的原因是它吸引了令人惊叹的人。

\[00:13:04\] The best talent out there can go anywhere.

[00：13：04]世界上最好的人才可以去任何地方。

They\'re not looking for jobs they\'re happy where there are.

他们不是在找工作，他们在那里很开心。

But what will make them change their situation is if there\'s a company that actually allows them to do what they believe is right and do what\'s important to them.

但让他们改变现状的是，如果有一家公司允许他们做他们认为正确的事情，做对他们来说重要的事情。

\[00:13:20\] And because of that we\'ve had an amazing experience attracting the most amazing people who are not just their skills aren\'t just out of out of control good but their hearts are as well and they are so motivated.

[00：13：20]正因为如此，我们有了一次令人惊奇的经历，吸引了最令人惊奇的人，他们不仅仅是他们的技能，他们不仅失去了控制，而且他们的心也很好，而且他们很有动力。

But for this mission of democratizing access to capital they continue to innovate every single day to help us achieve our mission.

但是，为了使获得资本的机会民主化这一使命，他们每天都在继续创新，以帮助我们实现我们的使命。

And lastly and this is the coolest part is your y actually attracts your customers.

最后，这是最酷的部分，你的Y实际上吸引了你的客户。

\[00:13:49\] Amazing customer.

[00：13：49]令人惊叹的顾客。

So we\'ve had customers like young or you know engineers out to Idaho not connected to any university or anything but they\'re just passionate about saving the world by creating solar powered streets and roads across across the world.

所以我们有像年轻人这样的客户，或者你知道，在爱达荷州的工程师们与任何一所大学都没有联系，但他们只是热衷于通过在世界各地建立太阳能供电的街道和道路来拯救世界。

They used to be getgo additive raising over two million dollars to bring their idea to life.

他们过去经常通过加法来筹集200多万美元来实现他们的想法。

And then this is one of my favorite ones you buy home.

这是我最喜欢的你买的房子之一。

This is awesome team of folks who are micro crowdsourcing your your genome or your bio.

这是一个很棒的团队，他们是微型众包，你的基因组或者你的生物。

Excuse me they got started because they were able to validate their market gauge interest on Indiegogo by raising thier threatener fifty thousand dollars.

对不起，他们之所以起步，是因为他们能够通过提高威胁者5万美元来验证他们对Indiegogo的市场评估利息。

\[00:14:27\] They then got into Y Combinator and now because of all of this traction success they just close their series.

[00：14：27]他们进入了Y组合器，现在由于所有的牵引成功，他们只是结束了他们的系列。

million Series C.

百万C系列。

So what\'s happening is we\'re giving all kinds of cool opportunities all kinds of ideas ideas that maybe the world would have passed over had they not had a chance to actually see see them bubble up and thrive.

所以现在发生的事情是，我们给了各种各样的机会，各种各样的想法，也许如果他们没有机会看到它们泡起来并茁壮成长的话，世界就会放弃这些想法。

So the question is how do you guys get clarity on your why.

所以问题是你们怎么弄清楚你们的原因。

Well not to be Medha here.

别在这里待着。

There\'s a very simple exercise I learned in business school which is the five y exercise which is start with a statement.

我在商学院学到了一个非常简单的练习，那就是从一个陈述开始的五个y练习。

Why are you doing to the company that you want to start and.

你为什么要对你想创办的公司。

Explain that to yourself and then ask yourself like a two year old would.

向自己解释，然后像两岁的孩子一样问自己。

Why again and then why again and keep going until you get to a place where you\'re totally irrational where you\'re just explaining the reason you\'re doing this is because of a belief and when you get to that kind of irrational place that means you have something really real there and for us my why was I wanted to democratize funding.

为什么一次又一次地坚持下去，直到你到达一个你完全不理性的地方，你只是在解释你这么做的原因是因为一种信念，当你到达那种非理性的地方，这意味着你在那里有一些真实的东西，对我们来说，我为什么想让资金民主化。

Well why do I care about that.

那我为什么要关心这个。

Well it\'s because finance is broken and inefficient and it\'s due to this reliance on gatekeepers.

这是因为金融失灵和效率低下，这是由于对守门员的依赖。

Why is the reliance on key gatekeepers not good.

为什么对关键看门人的依赖不好呢？

Well because it doesn\'t allow for equal opportunity.

因为它不允许机会均等。

So why is equal opportunity important.

那么为什么平等机会是重要的呢？

Because I\'d feel like life should be fair so why should life be fair.

因为我觉得生活应该是公平的，那么为什么生活应该是公平的呢？

I just believe it.

我只是相信。

\[00:15:43\] It\'s just what I believe.

[00：15：43]这正是我所相信的。

\[00:15:45\] It\'s irrational.

[00：15：45]这是不合理的。

It\'s just what I believe.

这正是我所相信的。

And that was so core to me that that was the reason why I knew I was onto something and that I need to stick with it.

这对我来说是如此的核心，这就是为什么我知道我在做什么，所以我需要坚持下去。

So do that exercise the second second lesson we learned is to be intentional with your culture.

所以做这个练习，我们学到的第二个教训就是要有意识地运用你们的文化。

So culture is is it\'s this big amorphous word that people like to throw around.

所以文化就是人们喜欢到处乱扔的这个大的、无定式的词。

All it is is who is who you are and how and how you are.

一切都在于你是谁，你是怎样的人。

It\'s the people within You\'re within your team and it\'s how you behave.

这是你内部的人\在你的团队里，这是你的行为方式。

Every single day.

每一天。

And the biggest mistake I see my fellow entrepreneurs making is this they always put culture 11th on their top 10 priority lists.

我看到我的企业家们犯的最大的错误是，他们总是把文化放在他们的十大优先事项清单上。

\[00:16:24\] Literally it\'s always important.

[00：16：24]从字面上讲，它总是很重要的。

But it never makes the cut.

但它从来没有被切割过。

I was actually at a dinner with some fellow entrepreneurs a few months or years ago and this is exactly what he said.

实际上，几个月或几年前，我和一些其他企业家共进晚餐，他就是这样说的。

There was a fellow entrepreneur who said it\'s so important.

有一位企业家说这件事很重要。

It means everything it actually determines whether we\'re successful or not.

它意味着它实际上决定了我们是否成功。

But I I never I never can get to it.

但我.我永远也找不到。

And I said Oh you\'re getting to it.

我说，哦，你快到了。

There is a culture.

有一种文化。

It is happening no matter what.

无论如何都在发生。

No matter whether you want to admit it or not you\'re just not being intentional about it.

不管你是否愿意承认，你都不是故意的。

So who knows what kind of culture you\'re building if you\'re actually setting yourself up for success.

那么，谁知道如果你真的在为成功做准备的话，你会建立什么样的文化呢？

So the key is to make it a priority and for us we\'ve had we\'ve made the kind of people we attract a priority.

因此，关键是要把它作为优先事项，而对于我们来说，我们已经把我们吸引到的那种人作为优先考虑的对象。

Diversity.

多样性。

There\'s so much research out shows that diversity drives are why innovation.

有如此多的研究表明，多样性驱动是创新的原因。

If you\'re trying to change the world you\'re trying to build something really meaningful in this world which I hope all of you guys are thinking about doing.

如果你想改变这个世界，你就会试图在这个世界上建立一些真正有意义的东西，我希望你们所有人都在考虑去做。

You need the best ideas the most diverse ideas the most diverse perspectives to actually get there.

你需要最好的想法，最多样化的观点，才能真正做到这一点。

Because if you don\'t have that you\'re going to a group think you\'re gonna fail.

因为如果你没有，你就会去一个团体，认为你会失败。

And because of this we\'ve actually done a pretty good job.

正因为如此，我们实际上做得很好。

We\'re over almost 50 percent women and an ego go over 30 percent of our engineers are women.

我们超过了将近50%的女性，而自我超过30%的工程师是女性。

\[00:17:32\] Also very excited.

[00：17：32]也很兴奋。

\[00:17:36\] We have more work to do on the ethnic side.

[00：17：36]我们在种族方面还有更多的工作要做。

But again it\'s back to a diversity of perspectives backgrounds experiences.

但它又回到了不同的视角、背景、经验。

\[00:17:42\] All of that is incredibly important for you setting up so if you\'re a one person team right now or two person team this is the perfect time to be thinking about this and going out and finding partners and team members who are nothing like you who think differently because you by doing that one thing you will set yourself up for success.

所有这些对你的建立来说都是极其重要的，所以如果你现在是一个团队或两个人的团队，这是一个很好的时间来思考这个问题，去寻找和你完全不同的伙伴和团队成员，因为你做了一件事，你就会成功。

The second thing is that culture again it\'s it\'s not it\'s just it\'s who you are and it\'s how you act.

第二件事是文化，这不只是你是谁，而是你的行为方式。

It\'s how you are everyday how you act.

这是你每天的样子，你的行为。

And I actually don\'t believe in this concept that there\'s good cultures and bad cultures there\'s just strong cultures and cultures and want a strong culture is a culture where the values and behaviors that the people exhibit and embody everyday are the values and behaviors that the company needs its people to exhibit everyday to win.

事实上，我不相信有好的文化和坏的文化，只有强大的文化，想要强大的文化是一种文化，在这种文化中，人们每天表现和体现的价值观和行为就是公司需要员工每天展示的价值和行为才能赢得。

Very simple.

很简单。

And so how do you know what values and behaviors you need.

所以你怎么知道你需要什么价值观和行为。

You need to to have to win.

你必须赢。

What starts with you.

从你开始。

The founders.

创始人。

And it\'s not like this big heady theoretical exercise.

这不像这么大的理论练习。

It\'s actually an exercise of distillation of self revealing or self reflection.

它实际上是自我揭示或自我反思的升华练习。

And so the way we got there to our values at least is I made all my co-founder and I sit down around the table and in five minutes Drost six pictures that answer the question I love coming to work at IndieGoGo because literally I learn that moment in time.

因此，我们实现价值观的方式至少是，我让我的共同创始人和我坐到桌子旁，在五分钟内就有六张照片回答了我喜欢去IndieGoGo工作的问题，因为我真的是及时学到了那个时刻。

My co-founder and I were terrible drivers and that design was going to be a key skill set.

我和我的共同创始人都是糟糕的司机，这个设计将是一个关键的技能。

They were going to need to fill as soon as possible.

他们需要尽快填补。

But what it actually revealed is that my cofounders and I in our early team all can work for the same for reasons and for us what your reasons might be different but for us the reasons we came to work everyday as the first was we wanted to change industry in changing an industry that had never been changed.

但它所揭示的是，在我们早期团队中，我和我的联合创始人都可以为同样的原因而工作，也可以为我们提供不同的理由。但对于我们来说，我们每天工作的原因是，我们想要改变行业，改变一个从未改变过的行业。

That got us excited.

这让我们很兴奋。

I got us motivated and that\'s where fearlessness came from.

我激发了我们的积极性，这就是无畏的源泉。

The second reason we all came to work everyday.

我们每天都来上班的第二个原因。

We wanted to bring our whole selves to work.

我们想要全身心投入工作。

You don\'t have to be anybody else.

你不必是别人。

Put on a metaphorical union uniform or a real uniform.

穿一件比喻的统一制服或真正的制服。

We just wanted to be ourselves.

我们只是想做自己。

And that\'s where authenticity came from.

这就是真实性的来源。

The third reason was Whoops let me go back.

第三个原因是让我回去。

Sorry.

抱歉的

The third reason was we all wanted to work with people that we had and build something together.

第三个原因是我们都想和我们所拥有的人一起工作，一起创造一些东西。

So we work.

所以我们工作。

All of us were team sport people in high school in college.

我们都是大学里高中时的团队运动者。

None of us were solo acts.

我们都不是独唱。

We like to actually we liked environments where two plus two equals five that got us excited.

实际上，我们喜欢这样的环境：二加二等于五，这让我们很兴奋。

So collaboration became our third value and the fourth was we all wanted to spend our waking lives helping people that wanted to be helped.

因此，协作成为我们的第三个价值，第四个是我们都希望在清醒的生活中帮助那些想要得到帮助的人。

You\'re at work a lot especially in the early days of a startup.

你经常工作，尤其是在创业初期。

So for us what was super important is we wanted to be spending your energy helping people that wanted to be helped.

所以对我们来说，最重要的是我们想要花你的精力去帮助那些想要被帮助的人。

\[00:20:24\] Which is where empowerment came from.

[00：20：24]这就是授权的来源。

\[00:20:27\] And so in the early days what fearlessness for example meant to us is you know being super opportunistic really finding our way this idea word of crowdfunding didn\'t exist so we didn\'t know if we were onto something or not.

[00：20：27]所以在早期，无畏对我们来说意味着什么，你知道，成为超级机会主义者，真正找到了我们的方向-这个“众筹”这个词根本不存在，所以我们不知道我们是不是在做什么。

But the next thing we did and we actually just did this a year ago is we actually define the behaviors.

但接下来我们做的-我们一年前才这么做-我们实际上定义了这些行为。

Now today that really embody fearlessness so as we started to grow we realized that someone\'s definition of fearlessness over here was different from somebody else\'s definition of fearlessness.

现在真正体现无畏的今天，当我们开始成长时，我们意识到，在这里，人们对无畏的定义与其他人对无畏的定义不同。

And while we had been higher when we started hiring people we did skills interviews and put out that kind of stuff but we always did culture interviews which is to make sure that people\'s values and behaviors were aligned with the companies.

当我们开始招聘员工时，我们的水平更高，我们进行了技能面试，并推出了类似的内容，但我们总是进行文化面试，这是为了确保人们的价值观和行为与公司保持一致。

And what we\'ve done is we\'ve over time you have to continue to revisit these behaviors and so today what fearlessness means to us is ruthlessly prioritizing.

我们所做的是，随着时间的推移，你必须继续重新审视这些行为，所以今天，无畏对我们来说意味着无情的优先考虑。

It\'s people who say no to the less important things because we now have so many opportunities.

是人们对不太重要的事情说不，因为我们现在有这么多的机会。

It could easily could easily be that we lose our focus and that will actually kill our chance of actually democratizing access to capital.

我们很容易失去我们的注意力，这实际上会扼杀我们真正实现资本民主化的机会。

Same thing with awesome authenticity in the early days it really meant bring your whole self to work today because we are such a diverse team and we\'re our customers.

在早期，同样的事情也有着令人敬畏的真实性，它真正意味着让你的整个自我在今天开始工作，因为我们是一个如此多样化的团队，我们是我们的客户。

Everyone across the world.

全世界的每个人。

What really matters now and being authentic as some is is we\'re being respectful of different points of views.

现在真正重要的是，和一些人一样，我们尊重不同的观点。

And so we\'ve identified this.

所以我们确认了这个。

And one thing I should say is while you want a diversity of people and backgrounds and experiences which is where I started what you don\'t wanted diversity of is your values and behaviors because that\'s the glue that keeps everybody together.

我应该说的是，当你想要不同的人、背景和经历的时候-我开始的时候-你不想要的是你的价值观和行为的多样性，因为这是把每个人团结在一起的粘合剂。

And then what you do with this is when you\'ve clarified your values and any favors you actually operationalize it and you reinforce it through you screen everybody in your hiring process for it.

然后，当你澄清了你的价值观和任何帮助时，你就会把它付诸行动，并通过你在招聘过程中对每个人的筛选来强化它。

I promise you this kind of sounds nuts and bolts.

我向你保证，这种声音听起来很具体。

But is so critical because then you actually hire absolutely amazing people people that are not only off the charts with their skills but also off the charts with their alignment with with your mission you operationalize it how you get stuff done and how you reward and recognize.

但这是非常关键的，因为你实际上雇佣了非常棒的人，这些人不仅以他们的技能出类拔萃，而且还以他们与你的使命相一致的方式脱离了图表，你把它付诸实施，你如何完成任务，以及如何奖励和认可它。

\[00:22:30\] So every quarter we have an all hands which here here\'s one.

[00：22：30]所以每个季度我们都有一只手在这里。

But we give out IGIS and Wiggins Aigis our awards for people who completely embody our values.

但是我们给IGIS和WigginsAigis颁发了我们的奖项，奖励那些完全体现我们价值观的人。

Twiggy\'s are of course for people that make us laugh but it stands for whops IGIS.

Twigi‘s当然是给那些能让我们开怀大笑的人使用的，但它代表的是WOPS IGIS。

Aigis or something from the top down Aigis are given out by all of us.

自上而下的爱吉斯或什么东西都是由我们所有人给出的。

\[00:22:52\] So I go on I give other people Aigis based on how I feel they\'ve embraced and embodied our values and it\'s very democratic in that way but it\'s also very real and it\'s very raw and it also reinforces the fact that culture is not a top down thing it\'s not something you can create only something you can influence as leaders and it takes the rest of the people in your team to continue to reinforce it as well.

[00：22：52]所以我继续给别人Aigis，是基于我觉得他们接受并体现了我们的价值观，这是非常民主的，但它也非常真实，它很原始，它也强化了这样一个事实：文化不是自上而下的东西，它不是你作为领导者所能产生的东西，它占据了其余的东西。你团队中的人也要继续加强它。

But it has to start with you.

但必须从你开始。

And then you can measure it.

然后你就可以测量它了。

Nothing would be good.

没有什么是好的。

You\'re not a good Silicon Valley tech startup if you\'re not measuring yourself.

如果你不衡量自己，你就不是一个好的硅谷科技初创公司。

And so we do actually we measure ourselves of how intentional we are we are being with our culture and one way to do it is is measure our engagement and happiness.

事实上，我们衡量的是我们对我们的文化是多么的有意，其中一种方法就是衡量我们的投入和幸福。

So we do an employee survey which is how how likely are you to refer a friend to come work here similar to customer service.

因此，我们做了一个员工调查，这是你有多大可能会推荐一个朋友来这里工作，类似于客户服务。

What you probably learned about.

你可能学到的东西。

And then we also have rolled out OK here\'s which\'s productivity metrics How well are we actually getting the things that we want to get done.

然后，我们也推出了好的，这里的生产力指标，我们实际上有多好，我们想要完成的事情。

Again a strong culture is a culture where people\'s values and behaviors that the company needs to win are the ones that people authentically embody every day.

再一次，一种强大的文化是一种文化，在这种文化中，人们需要赢得的价值观和行为是人们每天真正体现的价值观和行为。

And when people are themselves embodying the values of behaviors that they hold naturally they are more productive they are more happy.

当人们自己体现他们自然拥有的行为的价值时，他们就越有效率，他们就越快乐。

\[00:24:04\] And so you\'re your execution and the company\'s results should actually show that alright.

[00：24：04]所以你是你的执行者，公司的结果应该能证明这一点。

\[00:24:11\] Lesson number three and have two more minutes.

[00：24：11]第三课，还有两分钟。

\[00:24:16\] We\'re all here in the Valley.

[00：24：16]我们都在山谷里。

We\'re all probably interested in technology were here interested in entrepreneurship.

我们可能都对技术感兴趣，而这里则对创业感兴趣。

\[00:24:22\] But one thing I\'ve learned in all of this is that technology is not the end.

[00：24：22]但我在这一切中学到的一件事是，技术不是终点。

It\'s simply a means to an end.

这只是达到目的一种手段。

And if I look back and see how I got to where I am today starting from a young girl it wasn\'t like I said I want to be a technology entrepreneur.

如果我回头看看我是如何从一个年轻女孩做起的，那不是像我说的那样，我想成为一名科技企业家。

One day what I did is I focused on my wife.

有一天我把注意力集中在我妻子身上。

I focus on a problem that really bothered me at my core and I focus on that and I realized I wanted to fix something and to fix that starting a company would be the best way to do it.

我专注于一个真正困扰我的问题，我专注于这个问题，我意识到我想要解决一些问题，并且想要解决这个问题，创办一家公司将是最好的方法。

So I actually became an entrepreneur because I had to.

所以我实际上成为了一名企业家，因为我不得不这样做。

And then I found technology is a solve because that was the best way to fix that.

然后我发现科技是一个解决方案，因为这是解决这个问题的最好方法。

And I think because I came to it that way we have the name and my co-founder and I have been able to build something truly truly meaningful that is really impacting the world changing the world making a lot of money and and growing it and literally changing the course of his work or changing history literally and changing the course of the future for all of finance and people across the world.

我想，因为我是这样来的，我们有了自己的名字，也有了我的共同创始人，我建立了一个真正有意义的东西，它真正地影响了世界，改变了世界，赚了很多钱，增长了它，真的改变了他的工作路线，或者真的改变了历史，改变了全世界所有金融和人民的未来。

\[00:25:20\] And someone noticed that if you could play the video in the private sector stepping up as well from Indiegogo and Etsy to Disney and Intel companies have pledged to help unleash a new wave of innovation here in America.

[00：25：20]有人注意到，如果你能在私营部门播放这段视频，从Indiegogo到Etsy，再到迪斯尼，英特尔公司都承诺帮助在美国掀起一股新的创新浪潮。

These companies do different things.

这些公司做的事情不一样。

They come from different industries but they share the belief that when we tap the potential of every American.

他们来自不同的行业，但他们相信，当我们挖掘每个美国人的潜力。

All of us are better off so this.

我们都比较好所以这样。

\[00:25:50\] Alone didn\'t ask him to say that.

[00：25：50]独自一人没有要求他那样说。

\[00:25:53\] That was awesome.

[00：25：53]太棒了。

When you have moments like that you remember them.

当你有这样的时刻时，你会记住它们。

There\'s lots of ups and downs.

有很多起伏。

This is one of the apps along our journey.

这是我们旅途中的应用程序之一。

And this was recently after we White House reached out we did a Maker Faire with them and he talked about this.

而这是最近，我们白宫接触，我们与他们做了一个制造者，他谈论这件事。

\[00:26:05\] But the point is those were included there not because again we hustled and hadn\'t had and say it it\'s because we actually built something meaningful worthy of talking about at that scale.

[00：26：05]但重点是，这些都包含在那里，并不是因为我们又一次匆忙，没有，说出来，这是因为我们实际上建立了一些有意义的东西，值得在这个尺度上讨论。

And actually one of the things that always I\'ll always remember is when we just raised a 40 million dollar round of capital a few months ago almost a year ago I guess now and.

事实上，我永远记得的一件事是，几个月前，我们刚刚筹集了4000万美元的资金，我猜是在一年前。

\[00:26:29\] We were talking to Kleiner Perkins they were part of the round but before they had decided to invest Gondor came to me and he said regardless of whether or not we have the opportunity to invest in you you should know you\'ve built a really important company.

[00：26：29]我们和凯鹏华盈谈过，他们是这轮谈判的一部分，但在他们决定投资刚铎之前，他告诉我，不管我们是否有机会投资，你都应该知道你已经建立了一家非常重要的公司。

\[00:26:45\] The world as you guys sit here thinking about what you want to go build and what problems you want to go solve.

[00：26：45]当你们坐在这里思考你们想要建造的东西，以及你们想要解决的问题时，这个世界。

Don\'t think about how do I get really how do I get big fast that will happen.

不要想我如何得到真正的，我如何获得更大的速度，这将发生。

If you actually build something super meaningful and super important you don\'t think about you know what is the quickest way to success.

如果你真的建立了一些非常有意义和非常重要的东西，你就不会去想，你知道什么是通往成功的最快捷的方法。

Think about what is the best way to building something important that the world really needs.

想想什么是建立世界真正需要的重要东西的最好方法。

And when you do that you have customers like this and this is a campaign that just went live.

当你这样做的时候，你就会有这样的客户，这是一场刚刚开始的活动。

We\'re literally unleashing another catalyst tool of IT organization that will unleash even more people to go into technology.

我们实际上正在释放IT组织的另一个催化剂工具，它将释放更多的人进入技术领域。

The Hour of Code they just launched their campaign this week.

本周，他们刚刚发起了他们的竞选活动。

They\'re raising five million dollars.

他们筹集了五百万美元。

Reid Hoffman who is about to come speak has committed to matching with Bill Gates and Microsoft.

即将发言的里德·霍夫曼(Reid Hoffman)承诺与比尔·盖茨(Bill Gates)和微软(Microsoft)保持一致。

Salesforce are matching2.5 million dollars if the people can raise two and a half million dollars for an Hour of Code and the goal is to bring coding to 100 million people across the world.

Salesforce的收入高达250万美元，如果人们能在一小时内筹集到250万美元的话，我们的目标是为全世界1亿人提供编码。

That is something you guys can do today if you want to be part of that you can fund that campaign.

这是你们今天可以做的事情，如果你们想成为其中的一部分，你们可以资助这场运动。

And after that I want you all to go home and think about your why thinking about how do you attract people who think differently than you.

在那之后，我希望你们都回家，想想你们为什么要考虑如何吸引那些与你想法不同的人。

\[00:28:02\] And also think about how technology is just your tool and your mechanism for making change.

[00：28：02]，也想想科技是你的工具，也是你做出改变的机制。

It\'s not be the end goal in itself but with that I think you.

它本身并不是最终的目标，但我认为你是这样做的。
